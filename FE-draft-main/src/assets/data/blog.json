Street workouts, calisthenics parks, they all have that kind of outdoor vibe. So what should calisthenics athletes do over the winter months? Let’s talk about how to shift gears to make the most of the darker days so you can show off some serious strength gains.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Should you change your calisthenics training in winter?</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Do calisthenics athletes change the way they train over the winter months? Some opt for a strategic periodisation of weight training to add muscle mass and strength. Others continue to focus on calisthenics skills and flows, but bring their training indoors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">There’s no right or wrong way to approach winter training for calisthenics, but we think it’s a smart idea to consider a structured approach to training as the seasons change.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How to periodise calisthenics training in a year</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Periodisation could be the secret to progressing your calisthenics training to the next level. Periodised training is a way to use overload, recovery, and adaptation in a strategic and measurable way.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Macrocycles</strong>: large blocks of training (usually 4+ months)</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Mesocycles</strong>: training blocks within a macrocycle season (i.e. strength phase)</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Microcycles</strong>: small blocks within a mesocycle (usually one week of training)</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">By using a periodised approach to your entire year of training, you can really use the winter to your advantage. Turning winter into either one macrocycle, or 1-2 mesocycles (as part of a longer-term goal) allows you to overload, rest, adapt and come out stronger.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Structure calisthenics training in the off season</strong><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong>\n</h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Winter is great time to focus on building a solid strength foundation for your calisthenics. Everything about this time of year lends itself to strength work – the weather (training needs to move into the gym), the food (extra calories for the gains) and fewer opportunities for competitions and events.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Think about your goals for next year – do you want to unlock certain advanced skills, be a stronger athlete, or have more endurance? You can start working on all of those end-goals right now, over winter. Use this season to build your strength, work on weaknesses, and lay the groundwork for mastering new movements in spring.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Gym strength training and weighs for calisthenics</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Should calisthenics athletes really incorporate weights into their winter training? Some fans of calisthenics shy away from free weights and weights machines in the gym, worried about building up too much muscle mass or losing their range of motion.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">We think it’s a really good idea to incorporate weights into your training plan over the winter months. We’re not suggesting you suddenly go full-on powerlifter mode, shifting massive amounts of weight.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">But a smart approach to strength training and rest days will undoubtedly benefit your calisthenics practice, balance out your physique, and get you stronger in all the right places.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Don’t fear weight training for calisthenics. You won’t suddenly bulk up or get too heavy for all your favourite balances and pulling movements. But you will build strength and push through muscle-related plateaus.<br><br></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">7 winter training tips for calisthenics athletes</strong></h2>\n<ol data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Set your calisthenics goals for next year (strength, endurance, a particular skill?)</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Identify the weaknesses that are currently holding you back from reaching those goals</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Design a strength-training programme that builds the strength you need to unlock those long-term goals</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Do strength training 3+ times a week to maximise strength and lean mass gains</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Use a variety of rep ranges including 3-5, 5-8, 8-12 to maximise hypertrophy</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Take more rest days than usual to allow your body to adapt to the new heavier training stimulus</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Include mobility work and active recovery including walks, stretching, and foam rolling</li>\n</ol>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How to get calisthenics strong in the winter</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">If you decide to focus on gym strength training over winter, you don’t have to completely wave goodbye to calisthenics work until next year. You can still do 2-3 calisthenics workouts a week, mainly to keep your basic skills there. Or you could add a short calisthenics flow onto the end of your gym workouts as a finisher.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">But don’t fall into the trap of trying to do a full weights programme and a full calisthenics programme. Not only will you be too tired and sore to do either thing properly, you will limit your body’s ability to adapt to the training.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Think about how many weight training sessions you can do a week, and make sure your strength programme covers all body parts at least twice a week. Here’s an example of how you could do this:&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">2 weights sessions a week: full body sessions</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">2 weights sessions a week: push focus, pull focus, legs focus</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">4 weights sessions a week: upper focus, lower focus, repeat</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">However you decide to structure your winter training, make sure it’s an enjoyable way to close in on your long-term goals.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">And if you need any strength tools to help with those winter gains, head to the Gravity Fitness store and check out our kettlebells, weighted vests, macebells, Indian clubs and more.</p>"

   "detail": " <h1 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How to build muscle with calisthenics</strong>&nbsp;</h1>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Calisthenics is a great style of training for lots of things – mastering your bodyweight, increasing mobility, functional fitness. But is it good for hypertrophy? Calisthenics comes under the umbrella of strength training, but many people would question whether it’s possible to truly build muscle using calisthenics. Let’s look into it.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Is calisthenics the same as strength training?</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Strength training is a wide category that incorporates any training style that uses resistance. Strength training can range from heavy barbell training like Olympic weightlifting and powerlifting, to bodybuilding, to using weights machines at the gym. And – yes – it also includes using your own bodyweight as resistance.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Calisthenics is the art and sport of mastering your own body, using bodyweight as a resistance tool. So yes, calisthenics can definitely be considered strength training.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Can you build muscle doing calisthenics?</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">This brings us on to the key question of using calisthenics to build muscle. Many people think that because calisthenics doesn’t use external loads – like barbell, dumbbell, or machine weights – it can’t build muscle.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">We say go and look at the physiques of top calisthenics athletes! There are plenty of jacked and stacked calisthenics athletes out there who do nothing but calisthenics, rig work, and bodyweight training. Obviously genetics plays a part. But the fact remains, anyone can build muscle using calisthenics.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How do you build muscle?</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The human body needs certain criteria to build muscle. These include mechanical tension (stretching tension and contracting tension), time under tension (sets, reps, tempo), load, metabolic stress, and training frequency. Calisthenics provides all of these.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">In fact, we’d argue that a decent calisthenics routine plus above-average nutrition will lead to better muscle gain than a free weights routine plus sub-optimal nutrition!</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Best ways to build muscle from calisthenics</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">So you want to use calisthenics to build muscle? Smart idea. There are so many reasons to love calisthenics training. It’s simple, portable, can be done anywhere and anytime. You don’t even need any equipment (although a few basic bits of kit can seriously level up your calisthenics game). You don’t need a gym membership or lengthy workouts&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The best way to build muscle using calisthenics is to pick a few basic movements that cover the key muscle groups. Make sure you can do good form, and give yourself room to scale up the intensity.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Train frequently (but give yourself time to recover). You can’t expect to build serious muscle with one or two calisthenics sessions a week, but you wouldn’t expect to put on size with a couple of gym sessions either.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Just like with any kind of strength training, make sure your calisthenics sessions cover push, pull, legs, core, and full body movements. Remember that you don’t need to do isolation exercises like biceps curls when you’re a calisthenics athlete. Calisthenics movements create tension throughout the body and pack a lot into every exercise.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">22 best calisthenics exercises for muscle growth</strong></h2>\n<ol data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Ring rows</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Pull ups</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Chin ups</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Hindu push up</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Archer push up</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Down dog push up</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Front lever</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>L-sit</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Squat thrust</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Tuck raise</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Handstand holds</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Maltese plank</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Plank</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Reverse plank</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Shoulder taps</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Skull crusher</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Pike</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Frog planche</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Air squat</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Bear crawl</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Box jump</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Cossack squat</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How to build leg size with calisthenics</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">One thing people love to criticise calisthenics for is its comparative lack of leg exercises. We get it, when you compare lower body calisthenics movements like pistol squats and sissy squats to a huge deadlift or a stacked leg press, it can look too light.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The trick to using calisthenics to build leg size is to work with sets, reps, and tempo to increase time under tension. 4 sets of 8 pistol squats, done to depth, with a slow tempo will build more muscle than a few shaky reps on the hack squat machine where you don’t even break parallel.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">5 tips for building muscle with calisthenics</strong></h2>\n<ol data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Build a routine that covers major movements (push, pull, press, core, trunk, legs)</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Move on to higher level versions of movements as you progress</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Use rep ranges of 6-8 or 10-12</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Increase volume by increasing sets to around 4-6 sets</strong></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Use tempo to get more time under tension (3+ second eccentric)</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Calisthenics for muscle gain</strong><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong>\n</h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">We hope we’ve tempted you to try calisthenics for functional, athletic looking muscle that moves well and looks great.

You don’t need a gym membership, tons of fancy equipment, or any previous experience.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">But – like all forms of exercise – calisthenics works best when you also do a bit of stretching and mobility. Calisthenics works certain areas of your body hard, like the hands and wrists, forearms, shoulders, and upper back. Get more out of your calisthenics practice by spending a little time on stretching out those key areas.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Why should you stretch in calisthenics?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Whether you’re a total beginner to calisthenics or an advanced practitioner of bodyweight exercises, there’s no denying that this kind of workout demands a lot from certain areas of your body. Just like running asks a lot of your legs, and doing weights in the gym might make your muscles sore, calisthenics sends plenty of movement through your wrists, shoulders, back, and hips.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Regular stretching of these areas will make your calisthenics journey more enjoyable and successful. Not only will stretching ease off soreness or tightness after calisthenics training, it will also improve your mobility so you can practice more advanced exercises and make faster progress.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">What are the best stretches for calisthenics?</strong></h2>\n<h3 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Wrist and finger stretches for calisthenics</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Wrist circles -</strong> rotate your wrists in circular motions both ways. Then clasp your hands with fingers interlinked and move the wrists in small circles.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Wrist flexor stretch –</strong> get on all fours with your hands on the floor under your shoulders. Start with your fingers facing forwards, palms down. Make gentle rocking movements to mobilise and stretch the wrists. Turn the hands so your fingers are pointing out to each side and repeat. Finally, carefully turn your hands so your fingers are pointing towards your knees. If this feels too difficult, do one hand at a time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Finger stretches –</strong> on all fours, have the hands under the shoulders, fingers facing forwards. Lean gently over the wrists until the heel of your hands comes off the floor, creating a stretch in the fingers.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Wrist extensor stretch -</strong> kneel on the floor and put one arm out in front of you. Point the fingers to the floor so your palm is facing you. Apply gentle pressure with your other hand. Repeat on the other side.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Advanced wrist extensor stretch –</strong> on all fours, with hands under your shoulders, turn your hands so the top of your hand is on the floor. Lean forward slightly to feel a stretch up the front of the wrist and into the forearm.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Forearm stretches and mobility</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Forearm massage –</strong> use your hands to squeeze and massage each forearm before or after calisthenics work.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Advanced forearm massage –</strong> use a foam roller, hard ball, or even an empty barbell to roll out both side of the forearms, focusing on tight spots.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Shoulder stretches and mobility for calisthenics</strong></h3>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Shoulder dislocates –</strong> hold a PVC pipe or resistance band with both hands and slowly raise it over your head and behind your back, keeping your arms straight. Move your hands closer together as you warm up.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Wall angels -</strong> stand with against a wall and put the backs of your arms against the wall in a cactus position. Slide your hands up and down, keeping the arms against the wall.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Puppy pose –</strong> this yoga position is great for the shoulders and upper back/thoracic. From a tabletop or all-fours position, slide your arms forward, lowering your chest towards the ground whilst keeping your hips over your knees.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Thoracic and back stretches for calisthenics</strong></h3>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Cat-cow stretch –</strong> another yoga movement that’s great for the back. In an all-fours position, arch your back upward (bringing chin to chest) then lift your chest and tailbone to mobilise the neck, spine, and hips.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Thoracic extension -</strong> lie on your back with a foam roller placed under your upper back. Gently arch up and over the foam roller to stretch your thoracic spine.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How often should you stretch for calisthenics?</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Stretching in calisthenics is like stretching in any other sport – the more you do it, the more beneficial it will be. But let’s be realistic, none of us have hours of spare time a week to stretch. Even if you only do 5 or 10 minutes a day, it will have a huge benefit to your recovery, mobility, and enjoyment of calisthenics. Start by setting aside 5 minutes before or after a training session, then add in some non-training day stretching as well. You’ll never regret doing a bit of stretching!</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Check out the Gravity Fitness store for resistance bands, exercise mats and other top-quality calisthenics kit designed to make your training journey the best it can be.</p>"

Here’s how to use resistance bands for warm ups, prep work, strength, core training, mobility, and injury rehab.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">What are resistance bands used for?</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">What’s that hanging on a hook in the corner of the gym? Oh, just a load of resistance bands. Boring.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">If you tend to walk right past your gym’s resistance bands (or leave your own bands languishing at the bottom of your gym bag), we’re here to change your mind.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Resistance bands aren’t just for beginners (although they’re definitely beginner-friendly) nor are they only something you’d use if you’re injured. They are a legit training tool much loved by athletes and coaches the world over.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">List of 15 best exercises to do with resistance bands</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The humble (and cheap) resistance band is a reliable tool for joint mobility, movement prep, resistance work, assistance work, and of course for rehab and injury prevention. Here are some of the best ways to use a resistance band before, after or during your sessions.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">7 strength exercises using just a resistance band</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Resistance bands don’t rely on gravity, so you can use them at different heights and angles to work on strength. And whilst you can use resistance bands to actually add weight (resistance) to strength kit like barbells and fixed weighs machines, we really like using them to train the smaller, harder-to-activate muscle groups like the rear delts.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Resistance band push up</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;This version of a push up will recruit the stabiliser muscles as well as the major chest and shoulder muscles typically used in a push up. Create a horizonal resistance band “bar” by looping a thick/heavy band across the rig or around the spotter arms of a squat rack. Perform push ups on the band (the lower the band, the harder this will be).</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Banded face pulls&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">This classic resistance band exercise is easy to set up and great to do as a superset for rear delt machine or dumbbell work. By keeping the tension on the rear delts you can really play with tempo.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Spanish squat</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Attach the band to the rig and step into it, looping it around the back of your knees. Squat back and down, facing the attachment point of the band. This is a great squat variation that allows you to work on functional patterns and knee drive.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Banded hamstring curl&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Anchor the band around a solid point, lie on your front (away from the anchor point) and secure one heel/foot into the band. Brace your core and press your hips into the group as you perform a curl with the banded leg. Work on tempo (and don’t forget to swap sides).</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Resistance band thrusters&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">All the benefits of thrusters without a barbell. Step onto the band with both feet and hold the other end with both hands. Perform a thruster (squat into overhead press).</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Banded rows</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Great as a warm up, accessory, or superset for pull day. Attach the band to a sturdy anchor point and pull it towards your torso. Change the height of the band and the angle of your body to target different muscles.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Banded deadlifts&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">These are never going to be as heavy as barbell deadlifts, but they’re a great way to work RDLs into your session.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Best resistance band core exercises</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Banded Russian twists</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Sit with the band around your feet and hold the other end of the band in both hands towards your chest.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Banded plank</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Put the band across your upper back and hold the ends in each hand, creating extra tension as you hold a plank.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Mobility and warm up exercises with resistance bands</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Band pull aparts</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Hold a resistance band in a wide grip and raise it to chest height. Pull your arms out to the side, reducing the length of the band as your shoulders warm up.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Clam shells</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Put a band around your legs just above your knees. Lie on your side and open/close your knees whilst keeping your feet together and hips steady.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Banded walks</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">With a band around your legs just above or below your knees, walk sideways in a semi-squat stance. Take small steps and think about keeping your foot under your knee rather than leading with your foot.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Banded pull downs</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Attach a band to the rig or a pull up bar and hold the other end in both hands. Pull your hands down to your hips, keeping your arms straight, to warm up your lats.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Banded shoulder rotations</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Look after your rotator cuff by using a band before training. Attach it to an anchor point just lower than your shoulder. Pull the band back so your elbow is in line with your shoulder, then rotate at the shoulder to move your hand back and forward.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Banded glute activation</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Loop the band around the rig at ankle height and step into it, facing the rig (you might want to hold on to the rig for stability). Slowly kick/press your foot behind you with a slight bend in the knee. This is a small movement to get into the glutes.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Where to buy best resistance bands online</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Hopefully we’ve convinced you to stop ignoring resistance bands – they have so much to offer whether you’re a beginner, advanced or a pro athlete. And the great thing about them is they are pretty cheap and basically never wear out. Resistance bands are so cost-effective.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">We stock a range of <span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><a href=\"https://gravity.fitness/products/gravity-fitness-resistance-bands\" data-mce-href=\"https://gravity.fitness/products/gravity-fitness-resistance-bands\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">resistance bands</a></span> strengths and thicknesses, all with the Gravity Fitness quality you’ve come to expect.

Calisthenics truly is for everybody and every body. Here’s why everyone can do calisthenics.</schemaplus_faq_answer></p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Calisthenics is accessible to all body types</strong></h2>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">What comes to mind when you think of a calisthenics athlete? Someone relatively short, very lean, and light like a gymnast? That’s a limiting vision of calisthenics – and it’s actually not particularly accurate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Sure, there was a time when the only people who did calisthenics were the small guys and girls. But these days, calisthenics has expanded into strength challenges and muscle gain goals, and you will actually see a lot of pretty big calisthenics experts.</p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Still, we completely understand why the idea of doing calisthenics exercises might be intimidating if you’re tall, heavy, or very muscular. At Gravity Fitness we truly believe that calisthenics is for everybody (and every body), so please keep reading so we can convince you to give it a try!</p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Calisthenics is inclusive</strong></h2>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Calisthenics is often associated with jaw-dropping tricks like planche and human flag that only seem possible for very strong, very light people. But that’s really not the case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">First of all, calisthenics is definitely not just planche and human flag fancy tricks! Calisthenics is simply the art of mastering your own bodyweight. Simple movements like push ups and bodyweight squats count as calisthenics. The percentage of the calisthenics community who can do those awe-inspiring tricks is really very small. And you absolutely do not have to ever master a handstand or front lever to consider yourself “someone who does calisthenics”.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Calisthenics is accessible to all body types and incredibly important for promoting health, strength, and mastery of your own bodyweight. After all, if you can handle your own bodyweight, you are more likely to age well, experience fewer injuries, and do better in other types of training as well.</p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Can anyone start doing calisthenics?</strong></h2>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Calisthenics is perhaps the most accessible type of training in the world. All you need is your own bodyweight. If and when you want to start using equipment, it can be as simple as a pull up bar or a pair of parallettes. No gym, no rules. Just moving your body and having fun with it. This means that anyone, regardless of their age, fitness background, body type, or weight can do calisthenics – and will get benefits from it.</p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Is calisthenics a friendly sport?</strong></h2>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">As we’ve said, you don’t have to go to a gym to do calisthenics. But if you do want to tap into the calisthenics community, you won’t find a nicer bunch of people. Calisthenics communities are known for their inclusivity and support, sharing their progress, offering advice, and encouraging each other.</p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">If you want to find a calisthenics community near you, you’re in the right place. Gravity Fitness is right at the heart of the calisthenics movement and we’d be happy to help you find your people.</p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Why calisthenics is important for all body shapes and sizes</strong></h2>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Unlike other forms of training, calisthenics isn't just about aesthetics or burning calories. It’s about looking after your overall health both now and in the long-term. Doing short, regular calisthenics routines can improve heart health, help with flexibility, and increase bone density as well as help you build healthy muscle tissue through functional movements. These benefits are great whether you’re short or tall, big or small, heavy or light. It’s about being healthy and moving better.</p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<strong data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How to get started with calisthenics if you’re tall</strong><strong data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong>\n</h2>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Being tall is no barrier to doing calisthenics. There are no exercises you need to avoid. The main thing to consider is having enough room overhead, behind you, and out to the side when doing exercises that extend your body in one direction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">As a taller person, you may find some exercises more challenging simply because of your leverage. But this doesn’t mean you should avoid calisthenics. In fact, calisthenics will help you build muscle on those long limbs and strengthen up your joints so you’re less likely to experience back pain.</p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How to get started with calisthenics if you’re heavy</strong></h2>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">If you’re a heavier person you may think calisthenics is basically impossible. We promise you it’s not. In fact, using your bodyweight will encourage your muscles and joints to get super strong.</p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Consider using resistance bands or other assistance tools during pulling exercises (like pull ups, inverted rows, and anything involving hanging from a bar) at least when you start out. And pay extra attention to your hands, wrists, and shoulder joints after pressing and pushing movements.</p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">There’s more to calisthenics than fancy tricks</strong></h2>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Look, we admit it. We love to watch top calisthenics athletes do their fancy feats of strength and balance. But we don’t let that stop us from cracking on with our own calisthenics journey.</p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">There are so many undeniable benefits of doing calisthenics. It really is the best form of training for health, strength, and for mastering movement in everyday life.</p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Whatever size, shape, weight and height you are, there’s a way to do calisthenics safely and enjoyably. Don’t compare yourself to anyone else, just get out there and start moving your body with regular calisthenics workouts. You won’t regret it.</p>\n<p data-sanitized-data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">If you need resistance bands for a bit of extra assistance, or your first bits of calisthenics kit (like gymnastics rings, parallettes, or a pull up rack) do check out the Gravity Fitness store.

Calisthenics movements demand strength, control, and bodyweight mastery.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most calisthenics movements are slow and controlled rather than repping out as many as you can for time. So whilst you will elevate your heart rate by doing calisthenics, you won’t experience the same heart-pounding, sweat-pouring experience you’d get from a dedicated cardio session. But do you actually need cardio?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are lots of benefits to doing cardio alongside any other style of training.

But do you really need to do different workouts for cardio, strength, and mobility? Or can calisthenics training replace them all?&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Can you just do calisthenics workouts?</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Calisthenics is the art of using your bodyweight to build strength, flexibility, stability, balance, and mobility. Calisthenics movements encompass every movement pattern the human body needs – push, pull, squat, lunge, hinge, and rotation. And there are so many calisthenics exercises to learn (and so many ways to progress them) that you will never hit your limit with calisthenics</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;<strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Why is calisthenics a good all-round workout?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Calisthenics is one of the best forms of training - and fastest growing – forms of training on the planet. Huge numbers of people train calisthenics and only calisthenics, and they’re in amazing shape. So what exactly makes calisthenics such a great all-around workout for a variety of training goals?</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<ol data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Calisthenics helps you build significant strength and muscle. Exercises like pull-ups and dips target various muscle groups in the upper body, while squats and lunges engage the lower body muscles.</li>\n</ol>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<ol data-mce-fragment=\"1\" start=\"2\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Calisthenics is functional training, with movements that help you get stronger for everyday tasks (not just an aesthetic physique).</li>\n</ol>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<ol data-mce-fragment=\"1\" start=\"3\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Calisthenics helps you improve mobility, flexibility, and joint health because the movements take your body through different angles and full range of motion.</li>\n</ol>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<ol data-mce-fragment=\"1\" start=\"4\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">It’s convenient! Calisthenics can be done anytime, anywhere, however you like. You don’t need a gym membership or lengthy workouts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Are there any limits to calisthenics training?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">If your fitness goals are strength, functional fitness, stability, mobility, and enjoyment then calisthenics is an amazing all-round workout that will tick all those boxes. But it does have limits, and it’s obviously not going to be sufficient if you have a really specific goal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">For example, if you want to get super strong like a powerlifter, you’ll need to do specific barbell work. If you want to get huge like a bodybuilder, you’ll need to do additional hypertrophy training. And if you want to compete in an endurance sport, you’ll need to put in the miles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>If you need…progressive overload</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">You can definitely bring progressive overload into calisthenics work, but it’s not as easy as with barbells, dumbbells, and other weights equipment. Approach progressive overload in calisthenics by practicing more advanced versions of movements, or by using tempo work.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>If you need…leg day focus&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Calisthenics can work the lower body, but it’s more of a full-body training style. If you specifically want to do leg work, you might like to add in some weighted squat pattern and hip hinge exercises.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>If you need…endurance or conditioning work</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Calisthenics work will improve your cardiovascular fitness, but not as much as dedicated cardio like running or cycling. It’s a great idea to keep some cardio in your life for the many health benefits.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Can calisthenics replace the gym</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Yes, calisthenics can definitely replace the gym – which is great news for your budget and your time management! Calisthenics is such a great way to build strength, gain muscle, and stay active. It trains every body part and muscle group, and will help you develop an athletic and balanced physique. And don’t forget calisthenics can be done anywhere, in short bursts or longer workouts, making it the ultimate training style for busy lifestyles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How to replace the gym with calisthenics&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Calisthenics is an exciting and effective style of training that can replace the gym completely, or be a great addition to your gym routine. It's easy to start and offers endless ways to progress.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Get started with calisthenics by focusing on a few fundamental movements like push ups, pull ups or rows, knee raises or L-sits, and a squat variation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">And when you want to add some top-quality calisthenics equipment to your life, check out the <a href=\"https://gravity.fitness/collections/shop\">Gravity Fitness store</a> - we've got it all from the basics to new and innovative bits of kit!</p>"

Animal Flow is an interesting approach to mobility work that calls on ancient movement patterns that take the body back to nature.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">What is Animal Flow?</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Animal Flow, as the name suggests, is a flowing practice of movement combinations that take the body through specific shapes named after animals. Why animals? Animal Flow is built on the ethos that animals instinctively know how to move, and that the human animal has lost this innate knowledge over time. By getting back to animalistic ways of flowing movement, we can help our bodies be naturally strong, mobile, and free from injury.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Is Animal Flow the same as gymnastics or yoga?</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Animal Flow could be categorised as mobility work, but it’s definitely not the same as yoga. Yoga and Animal Flow both have their own theories, philosophies, and movements or shapes. Like yoga, Animal Flow is much more than stretching or mobility. It’s a great way to build strength, look after the joints, and build a fun movement practice.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Why is Animal Flow good for you?</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any form of mobility work is good for you – especially if you do calisthenics or bodyweight training. Animal Flow is particularly good because it moves your own bodyweight through all natural patterns and angles. The emphasis on flowing movement gives our bodies a welcome release from the static, sedentary nature of modern lifestyles.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Mobility</strong> – the range of movements in Animal Flow encourage joint mobility and flexibility as your body explores different planes of motion.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Strength</strong> – as you flow between movements, you will engage multiple muscle groups, making Animal Flow a full body workout.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Core</strong> - Animal Flow movements engage the core muscles, building stability that supports the rest of the body.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Neuromuscular co-ordination</strong> – the fluid transitions between movements challenges your brain-body connection to build coordination, agility, and proprioception.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Mind/body</strong> – like calisthenics, Animal Flow isn't just about physical gains. It’s mindful and playful, making it great for stress management.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">What to expect in an Animal Flow session</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can do Animal Flow in a class setting with a qualified instructor, or try it out yourself with Animal Flow videos online. The movements are broken down into stages and can be progressed from beginner to advanced.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All Animal Flow movements cover six key areas: wrist mobility, activation positions, form specific stretches, travelling forms, switches, and transitions, and flows which link the animal-based forms together using transitions.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Does Animal Flow go well with calisthenics?</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We think Animal Flow and calisthenics make an amazing combination. They share a lot of similarities and complement each other well. Calisthenics and Animal Flow both work on principles of using bodyweight to move the body through natural movements and angles. And both practices honour the body’s innate need to move, flow, and play.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How are Animal Flow and calisthenics similar?</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span>\n</h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Animal Flow gets its inspiration from various disciplines, including gymnastics and breakdancing. It combines primal movements in sequences that increase strength and mobility. Like calisthenics, Animal Flow aims to get you moving with grace and precision as you co-ordinate different shapes. And by using multi-planar transitions, both Animal Flow and calisthenics improve strength, mobility, and core stability.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Functional strength</strong> - Animal Flow and calisthenics encourage real-world strength using natural body mechanics.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Dynamic movement</strong> – the dynamic movements of calisthenics work well with Animal Flow to create a beautiful flow of strength.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Versatility</strong> - Animal Flow and calisthenics both offer a range of movements that will keep your routine fun and motivating.<br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Can you do Animal Flow and calisthenics together?</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can definitely do Animal Flow and calisthenics as part of your training routine. You could use Animal Flow as part of your warm up and mobility for calisthenics, or as a separate session to work on joint health and bodyweight strength. By combining the primal movement patterns of animals with the functional strength of calisthenics, you’ll get a well-rounded workout just as nature intended. Do you do Animal Flow? We’d love to hear from you.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out the Gravity Fitness store for best-selling calisthenics equipment to support your fitness journey your way – however, whenever, and wherever you choose.</p>"

It’s a wide-ranging workout style, with thousands of possible exercises. And it forms the basis of almost every other type of training and sport in the world. Calisthenics teaches you to move and control your own bodyweight - which is fundamental to everything else!</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Benefits of calisthenics training for women</strong></p>\n<ol data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Calisthenics workouts can be quick</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don’t have time for long training sessions (or don’t enjoy them), calisthenics is a great “quick win” style of training. You can get a lot done in a short calisthenics workout, and you can break up your training into short blocks throughout the day if that suits you better.</p>\n<ol data-mce-fragment=\"1\" start=\"2\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Calisthenics doesn’t need a gym membership</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can do calisthenics anywhere. At home, in the garden, outdoors, in a hotel gym, or on your travels. You don’t need any equipment – just your bodyweight. Yes, you can add calisthenics equipment like parallettes, pull up bars, or gymnastics ring into the mix.

Not sure which one is best for your training goals? Here’s everything you need to know about macebells vs clubbells.<br><br></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">What are steel Indian clubs aka clubbells</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Indian clubs – sometimes called “clubbells” – are a functional fitness tool based on Indian clubs that were introduced to the UK in the 19<sup data-mce-fragment=\"1\">th</sup> century. These ancient versions were used first as a weapon, then as a training tool for armies and athletes, before eventually being used as an Olympic sport.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Our <span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><a data-mce-fragment=\"1\" href=\"https://gravity.fitness/collections/all/products/gravity-fitness-steel-indian-clubs-clubbells-2kg-20kg\" data-mce-href=\"https://gravity.fitness/collections/all/products/gravity-fitness-steel-indian-clubs-clubbells-2kg-20kg\">Steel Indian clubs</a></span> are designed to feel instinctively good to hold, rotate, and swing for a range of functional movements.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">What&nbsp;is the steel mace aka macebells?</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Macebells or steel maces belong to the same functional fitness tool family as Indian clubs but have some significant differences in design. Whereas Indian clubs have more of a tapered shape, macebells have a thinner handle ending with a round ball shape. This gives macebells their distinctive uneven weight distribution which encourages the body to constantly adjust and counterbalance the weight.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Our <span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><a data-mce-fragment=\"1\" href=\"https://gravity.fitness/collections/all/products/gravity-fitness-macebells-steel-mace-4kg-12kg\" data-mce-href=\"https://gravity.fitness/collections/all/products/gravity-fitness-macebells-steel-mace-4kg-12kg\">steel mace macebells</a></span> are built to feel great in the hands and give you access to a vast range of unconventional workouts and exercises.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Are clubbells and macebells the same thing?</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">No, clubbells and macebells are not the same thing. Clubbells are Indian clubs, with a handle that tapers away to a club shape. Macebells are steel maces, with a straight long handle that ends in a small round ball. Both our clubbells and macebells are made from super strong welded steel, with a matte black finish for the ultimate in quality, hand feel, and workout results.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Differences between Indian clubs and steel mace's</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Given that Indian clubs and steel mace macebells are different tools, should you choose one over the other or can you use both? We think Indian clubs and steel maces both have a legit place for functional fitness, strength training, rehab, or to support more niche training styles.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Both of them give you a training stimulus you just won’t get from more regular forms of strength or resistance training like barbells, dumbbells or even other unconventional tools like kettlebells and sandbags.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The main difference is in the shape and design, which translates into a different feel as you swing or rotate the tool. Indian clubs are tapered, so the weight is more evenly distributed down the handle. Macebells have the majority of the weight concentrated in the ball at the end, making it less even especially when you rotate the mace around.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How to choose between Indian clubs and macebells</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">In an ideal world, you’d have access to Indian clubs and steel maces for your training. And ours are so affordable that maybe you can! But if you really need to choose, here’s what we think.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Macebells are great for working on joint mobility (especially shoulders), muscular awareness, and balance as you build strength. You can easily build a full body flow using macebells because they lend themselves well to swinging and rotational movements. They’re a truly unique tool that will give you a completely different kind of workout.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Indian clubs are great for building mobility alongside functional strength, and are a better direct swap for strength tools like a kettlebell. They can be used for strength exercises or for movement-based flows and are a good choice for prehab, rehab and warm ups as well as your main workouts.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Why are Indian clubs and steel mace good for functional training</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Both options are a really amazing way to target muscles and movement patterns that are often neglected in more traditional workouts and training styles. Indian clubs and steel macebells both instinctively encourage you to work the shoulder joints, core, torso, and thoracic spine using flowing, rotational exercises.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">If you want more mobility, better joint health, better range of motion, and a natural way to rehab after injury then one of these tools should definitely be in your training collection. And given that Gravity Fitness <span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><a data-mce-fragment=\"1\" href=\"https://gravity.fitness/collections/all/products/gravity-fitness-macebells-steel-mace-4kg-12kg\" data-mce-href=\"https://gravity.fitness/collections/all/products/gravity-fitness-macebells-steel-mace-4kg-12kg\">steel mace macebells</a></span> start at 4kgs and <span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><a data-mce-fragment=\"1\" href=\"https://gravity.fitness/collections/all/products/gravity-fitness-steel-indian-clubs-clubbells-2kg-20kg\" data-mce-href=\"https://gravity.fitness/collections/all/products/gravity-fitness-steel-indian-clubs-clubbells-2kg-20kg\">Steel Indian clubs</a></span> start at 2kgs, we've got an option for every level.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Best quality Indian clubs and steel macebells next day delivery</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Convinced that you need one or both for your home gym or on-the-go training collection?

With calisthenics, you are simply using your own bodyweight as load (rather than barbells or dumbbells). You can introduce equipment, like parallettes, gymnastics rings, or pull up racks but these are extremely safe.

This is probably because isometric holds increase muscle tension, restrict circulation, and then causes movement of blood when you release the hold.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How is blood pressure linked to better health and fitness</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">High blood pressure (hypertension) puts excess strain on blood vessels, the heart and other organs including the brain. High blood pressure has been closely linked to significant health risks, including heart disease, heart attacks, and stroke. These are some of the biggest risks to health and mortality, so it’s definitely worth exploring how we can use exercise to reduce our risk.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Best exercises for blood pressure and health</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The good news for us fitness folk is that any activity, plus healthier eating, will have a positive impact on blood pressure. Regular walking and increased NEAT, consistent training, and a diet with lots of fibre will put you in a good position. But if you want to know how to optimise your training time for lower blood pressure, isometric exercises might be the key.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">What are examples of isometric exercises</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Isometric exercises mean exercises that you hold in a static position, contracting the muscle without moving the joint. Some examples are wall sits, plank holds and side planks, glute bridges, overhead holds, and isometric ring rows. This means that calisthenics and bodyweight functional training is a great way to do more isometric raining in your workouts.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">15 isometric exercises you can do with calisthenics</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Isometric pull up hold</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Isometric ring row</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Isometric dip</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Bottom half push up hold</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Plank hold</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Side plank hold</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Front lever</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Hanging knee raises</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Dead hang</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Wall sit</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Glute bridge</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Static lunge</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Tuck hold on parallettes</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Handstand against wall</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Human flag</li>\n</ol>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">You don’t need any equipment to do isometric exercises in calisthenics, but if you want to get a set of wooden gymnastics rings, a pull up rack, or a set of parallettes you will be able to take your isometric work to the next level.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Is calisthenics the best workout for lowering blood pressure</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The BJSM systematic review suggests that isometric exercises are better than other forms of exercise for lowering high blood pressure. But we doubt you’ll want to just do isometric holds for the rest of your life. As always, the best approach is a balanced one.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Build your training plan around some resistance or strength training (with some isometric holds built into that), some cardio or extra activity (walking is great), and some stretching or mobility. Exercise as a whole is very good for looking after your heart health and blood pressure, and the best exercise is the one you enjoy so much you’ll keep doing it.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Best calisthenics equipment for isometric exercises</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Calisthenics is a great way to learn more about isometric holds and practice them in your own workouts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Gravity Fitness is the leading supplier of top-quality, athlete designed calisthenics equipment you can use at home, in the gym, or on the go.

Here’s how to make the most of short bursts of calisthenics training.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How long does it take to learn calisthenics skills</strong></p>\n<p>Calisthenics training is a powerful way to get stronger, learn new skills, and build a physique. But here’s the problem: we’re all busy. Life is packed full with work, home life, chores, appointments, and other obligations. It’s not always easy to carve out an hour for a workout, especially if you have to travel to a gym.</p>\n<p>That’s why calisthenics is an amazing training style when you’re time-poor. Calisthenics – the art of mastering your own bodyweight through strength training movements – can be done at home with minimal space and equipment. And, yes, we’d argue that you can learn and practice calisthenics skills in 5-minute bursts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Can you do calisthenics every day</strong></p>\n<p>Is it OK to do a calisthenics workout every day? Yes, it’s fine to do short calisthenics workouts or skills practice every single day if you want to. Calisthenics is low-impact and uses your whole body. So you could do “pull” movements one day, “push” the next, and core or lower body the day after that.</p>\n<p>And this article isn’t suggesting that you do 5 minutes of calisthenics every day for the rest of your life. But we’d like to show you how you can learn and master key calisthenics skills in very short blocks of time.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Can you learn calisthenics skills in 5-minute blocks</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s say you’ve got 5 minutes between work calls. Can you really get a meaningful amount of calisthenics skills work done in that time? Yes! One of the great things about calisthenics is that you can focus on the technique and strength needed for one movement or flow at a time.</p>\n<p>5 minutes is plenty of time to warm up and then practice scapular work, pull up progressions, and work on a few sets of full pull ups. The same applies to push-ups, l-sits, planche work, handstands, and dozens of other calisthenics skills.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How to practice calisthenics in 5 minutes</strong></p>\n<p>There are loads of calisthenics skills and movements you could practice in 5 minutes during the day. It will depend on what equipment you’ve got (if any) and what you want to work on. Here are a few things we’d suggest:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Pull ups (you’ll need a wall mounted pull up bar or portable pull up rack)</strong></p>\n<p>Pull ups are a fundamental upper body “pull” skill to master. Pull ups, and all the progressions that you’ll do along the way, will build strength and stability in the muscles and joints of the anterior chain – the shoulders, chest, core, wrists, scapulae, and serratus anterior.</p>\n<p>Pull ups teach you to engage the muscles like a chain throughout the whole body, and give you the opportunity to drill posture, alignment, form, hip elevation, core strength and more.</p>\n<p>In 5 minutes of pull up training, you could work through: scapular retraction, scapular pull ups, jumping or negative pull ups, full (strict) pull ups.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Push-ups (use parallettes, resistance bands, or no equipment)</strong></p>\n<p>Push ups are the ultimate no-equipment, do-anywhere calisthenics skill that transfers well to more advanced movements like planche and handstand. You can do push ups with no equipment, or use a set of parallettes to get more range.</p>\n<p>In 5 minutes of push up training, you could work through: box and kneeling push ups, wide, standard, or diamond push ups, banded push ups, tempo work, Hindu push ups and push into tuck (or L-sit) for an advanced option.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Handstands (use parallettes, a wall, or no equipment)</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are lots of other things you could learn or practice in 5-minute blocks – these are just three ideas to spark your imagination.</p>\n<p>Handstands build great shoulder strength and also work your back, arms, wrists, and core. Kicking up in to a handstand works your legs and hips. Handstands transfer well into other calisthenics skills like planche work and lever work.</p>\n<p>In 5 minutes of handstand training, you could work through: hollow body hold, diamond push ups, frog stand, pike push ups, wall handstand, wall walks, and handstand hold.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>5 ways to find 5 minutes for calisthenics training</strong></p>\n<p>1 In the morning before you start work</p>\n<p>2 Between work calls or meetings</p>\n<p>3 After work before you get on with your evening</p>\n<p>4 Whilst dinner is cooking</p>\n<p>5 Before bed instead of watching TV</p>\n<p>Gravity Fitness is your one-stop shop for calisthenics equipment, motivation, and info so you can explore calisthenics on your own terms.

   "detail": " <p><strong><u>Is Barefoot Training Best for Calisthenics?</u></strong></p>\n<p>The human foot is one of the biological marvels of evolution. With the ability to produce force, be hugely flexible and help us to stay bi-pedal, the human foot is an incredible piece of biomechanical engineering. So in our training and movement practice we need to make the most of this!</p>\n<p>Barefoot training allows us to train with a natural foot shape, allowing greater force output, better balance and more stability during movement. Barefoot training also allows us to adapt to our surroundings and impact as well. The foot is not designed to be penned up in shoes with smaller toe boxes, to condense our toes. It actually can throw off our natural gait and balance, as well as causing pain into the ankles, knees and hips. With our toes free, we can align our foot arch to be more flat across the ground allowing the foots surface area to make better contact with the ground and enable us to centre our weight over our toes, not our heels. That makes us the million dollar man – better, stronger, faster!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Knees over toes (ATG) is one of&nbsp;many&nbsp;guiding principles here, and with the freedom of training with bare feet, this is easier to do and it helps with visual feedback to know that the knees are, in fact, heading over the toes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Calisthenics training barefoot also allows our balance to improve by creating a better sensory input from the body, basically allowing us to sense more through the foot to help us to make the micro movements needed for better balance. During Calisthenics and particularly single leg work, this is a tool which we can implement, just by taking advantage of our biology.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Barefoot training needs patience, time and resilience. We wouldn’t personally recommend running with bare feet without a lot of prior training, as the impact can be very intense, particularly if you have had knee, ankle or hip problems in the past. However, walking barefoot is definitely encouraged, as this helps build extra resilience and helps our gait pattern.</p>\n<p>Any cardiovascular work where you are going to be bouncing around on your feet a lot, should have some level of protection such as barefoot shoes, or trainers where necessary. Barefoot shoes can help you achieve the spread of the feet and toes, whilst helping with the impact. They are designed to help your posture as you run, making your speed and power more efficient, so what’s not to love? Also, as a side note, if you do a lot of work on mats for your training, something with good grip is important from a health and safety perspective. So, again, barefoot shoes work well here.</p>\n<p>In summary, helping making the most of your feet during your calisthenics training as a great idea, and the best way to do that is to train with bare feet. Also any work on strengthening toe point, toe spread and the ankle are going to be a great fundamental tools to help secure you from the ground up. Give it a try and see how your balance, stability and technique improve, and at the same time you could alleviate foot, knee and hip pain, so what are you waiting for? Give lotus squats a try, or knife edge squats, working from the edges of your feet. Once you open up the box, it’s hard to go back to a narrow (toe) box!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Go ahead and give barefoot training a try!

   "detail": " <p><strong><u>What is unconventional training and how to get started</u></strong></p>\n<p>The word ‘unconventional’ is defined as meaning ‘not based on or conforming to what is generally done or believed’. And it is the same with unconventional training methods. Welcome to unconventional training 101 – your quick reference guide!</p>\n<p>What is unconventional training? Well, unconventional training is going against the norm, or the standard. Breaking the mould and moving in new, innovative and more healthy ways. We can also view unconventional training as functional training.</p>\n<p>How do we work with unconventional training? We use compound movements that we use in everyday life and add in different stimulus in different ways as opposed to the standard.</p>\n<p>But how does that benefit us as athletes? Well, for starters it means we master movement, and the ways in which are body moves throughout life, not just in the gym. Unconventional training also keeps our work varied, as we use differing pieces of equipment and planes of motion. This means that our body is always adapting to new stimuli, which means we will build muscle mass and strength more efficiently whilst also strengthening our connective tissues and improving our joint health.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Is there equipment I should be using? The wonderful thing about unconventional training as that there are so many options here, depending on what you enjoy! We can use Kettle bells, Maces, Indian Clubs, Skipping Ropes, Ankle Weights, Battle Ropes, Squat Ramps and more. All of which are available at Gravity Fitness. We have a dedicated store for unconventional and functional fitness, <a href=\"https://gravity.fitness/collections/unconventional-functional-fitness\">go check it out</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gravity.fitness/collections/unconventional-functional-fitness\"></a>If you want to be able to practice unconventional training at home, or on the go outside of a gym environment, you can’t go wrong with Indian Clubs, a Skipping Rope and Squat Ramps. These three pieces of equipment can help you master full body unconventional training.</p>\n<p>Squat Ramps allow us to practice lower body movements, by elevating the heel or the toe, to increase range and work different musculature through the VMO Squat &amp; VMO Glute Squat, the ATG Split Squat, the ATG calf raise, Jefferson Curls and the ATG squat. Being an ATG qualified coach myself, I know the importance of lower body work, and using squat ramps has helped my clients improve their joint health, build strength and alleviate pain.</p>\n<p>A Skipping Rope allows us to build endurance, work on our cardiovascular health and keep active, and it can be done in a small space, plus get outside in the fresh air! There are different steps and feet movements we can work on, which also helps our hand eye coordination. We can use Skipping as an interval too in our workouts to maximise effort and helo our speed and power.<br> <br> Indian Clubs are a fantastic way of building all round joint health as they allow us to work unilaterally (one side of the body) or bilaterally (both sides of the body) with maximum range of motion. Mostly used for shoulder and wrist work, Indian Clubs can also be used in squats and lifts too!</p>\n<p>To sum things up, unconventional training is the best way to keep all round body health and fitness at your maximum level, allowing you to work on building strength, muscle, strengthening your connective tissues and improving your joint health. You can get started in a gym environment or at home!

We strive to make the best equipment, the most functional equipment and the most versatile equipment to suit a huge range of demands and customers. And our Dip Belt is no exception.</p>\n<p>A standard Dip Belt is designed to add weight plates for dips. It is attached around the waist and fastened with a low hanging chain across the front, allowing the ability to stack weight plates that will hang in between your legs allowing you to add weight to the dip exercise. A traditional Dip Belt will do the job, sure. But, will it also enable you to add weight for pull ups as well? Will it also enable you to use it in Sled work or any heavy drags. Can it also be used as a back support by itself? I’m guessing probably not, and that’s where the Gravity Fitness Dip Belt comes into its own.</p>\n<p>Dip Belts in general are a fantastic purchase, and definitely a must have piece of equipment, when it comes to weighted calisthenics, skills, unconventional and functional training. But the Gravity Fitness Dip Belt is a completely different animal.</p>\n<p>The Gravity Fitness Dip Belt is super lightweight, meaning during those high stress movements, it won’t interfere with your balance or your alignment meaning you can stay safe and injury free, even under much larger weight.</p>\n<p>When you’re choosing a Dip Belt for yourself you want to make sure it’s comfortable, lightweight and that it won’t retain moisture and therefore smell. The Gravity Fitness Dip Belt is made from strong bonded nylon, so moisture and smell won’t be a problem and it won’t be a hassle to have in your gym bag. Plus with fabric based belts to suspend any weight from, the Gravity Fitness Dip Belt will ensure maximum load bearing capabilities and help avoid the uncomfortable feeling of chains around your hips that you get from a traditional Dip Belt.</p>\n<p>Flexible sizing is also an important part of that Dip Belt experience as you want to feel secure with extra weight, but not restricted. The Gravity Fitness Dip Belt is fully adjustable so the fit can be as unique as your workouts are. Flexible sizing is also very important for those movements with any heavy drag, as we need slight room to move. The Gravity Fitness Dip Belt thrives in the sledding environment for exactly this reason. The extra room allows us to generate more force and power, making our movements much more effective!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you decide to head out to the weights section of your gym, the Gravity Fitness Dip Belt can also be used as a weight belt for that extra lumbar support during those heavier lifts. It’s always good to keep working those fundamentals! This extra lumbar support can help keep that form nice and solid as you will be using the belt as a good feedback mechanism during your reps and lifts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gravity.fitness/products/gravity-fitness-advanced-4-in-1-heavy-duty-workout-dip-belt?_pos=1&amp;_sid=469657515&amp;_ss=r\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0276/0635/1961/files/Gravity_Fitness_dip_Belt_480x480.png?v=1686805642\" alt=\"\"></a><br>In summary, the <a href=\"https://gravity.fitness/products/gravity-fitness-advanced-4-in-1-heavy-duty-workout-dip-belt?_pos=1&amp;_sid=469657515&amp;_ss=r\">Gravity Fitness Dip Belt</a>is versatile, well built, flexible and lightweight to help you through those powerful movements such as pull ups, dips and sled work.

Fitness isn’t defined by the gym!</schemaplus_faq_answer></p>\n<p>Training is about more than how you look or how muscular you are. It’s about mastering your body, living as a healthy human, and being able to move as nature intended.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2><strong><schemaplus_faq_question>How can you get fit without a gym</schemaplus_faq_question></strong></h2>\n<p><schemaplus_faq_answer>It’s easier than you think to reach your fitness goals without a gym membership (after all, how did people get fit or strong before gyms were invented?) The best ways to be train without a gym involve bodyweight training, or using minimal equipment. Functional training tools and calisthenics equipment allow you to train anywhere, any time, on your own terms.</schemaplus_faq_answer></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>4 ways to train without a gym</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Walk, hike or run</strong></p>\n<p>Move your body whichever way feels best. Walking, running, jogging, hiking need no specialist equipment (aside from footwear) and can be done anywhere, anytime. And even 10 minutes counts. Add a weighted vest to take things up a notch.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Bodyweight circuits</strong></p>\n<p>Your body is the ultimate training equipment. Use it as a resistance tool by combining squats, lunges, glute bridges, push ups, press ups, pull ups, inverted rows, burpees or down ups, core work and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Calisthenics training</strong></p>\n<p>Calisthenics is the original training protocol and underpins almost every sport. This style of training lets you master your own bodyweight and train your body through natural ranges of movement. You don’t need much equipment – a set of parallettes, maybe a pull up bar, or gymnastics rings will unlock a world of calisthenics training.</p>\n<p><strong>Unconventional/odd object workouts</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Unconventional training with tools like Indian clubs, steel maces, macebells, and kettlebells promotes functional fitness that can be done pretty much anywhere. Can you carry a kettlebell in your car, or keep a couple of macebells at home? There you go – you can do effective functional workouts any time.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is anywhere any time training?</strong></h2>\n<p>We believe fitness should be anywhere, any time. Your training shouldn’t be dictated by gym opening hours or access to specialist equipment. Your body is the ultimate training tool, and you don’t need loads of space or tons of time. Short bodyweight, gymnastics or calisthenics workouts every day are an amazing way to train. Micro-bursts of movement during the working day will keep your body moving.</p>\n<h2><strong>5 benefits of exercising without a gym</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Boost your NEAT</strong></p>\n<p>NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis) is all the calories we burn from just moving around during the day. And it accounts for the largest percentage of calories we can possibly burn. Increasing NEAT is the easiest and most sustainable way to keep body weight under control.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Grease the groove</strong></p>\n<p>The concept of greasing the groove means daily practice of a skill or movement to make it second nature. Install a pull up bar at home and you can do a couple of pull ups every time you get up from your desk.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Beat the sedentary lifestyle</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Stop thinking about workouts as a gym-based activity and start thinking about moving your body as often as you can. You’ll rack up the steps, burn more calories, and offset all the sitting down we do at work and at home.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Get fit on your terms</strong></p>\n<p>Ditching the gym for calisthenics or functional fitness puts the power back in your hands. No rules, no timetables, no location. You can train however you want, whenever you can.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Discover new forms of fitness</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Restricting training to the gym takes some of the joy out of it. Bring back a sense of fun and play by seeing what your body is capable of. Set yourself challenges, learn new skills, master your own bodyweight.

   "detail": " <p><strong>Street workout, streetlifting, or calisthenics best for building strength?</strong></p>\n<p>What’s the difference between calisthenics, street workout, and street lifting for getting fit and strong?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What is street workout?</strong></p>\n<p>Street workout is an urban fitness activity that has its roots in calisthenics and bodyweight training. As the name suggests, it originated in outdoor spaces like urban parks and public areas. Street workouts started out in big cities in the United States, Russia, Eastern Europe and Israel. But street workouts are getting popular in most cities, so maybe you’re wondering if you should get involved in street workouts near you?</p>\n<p>Street workouts are typically split into two categories – strength training (isometric holds) and dynamics (fluid movements between holds). Common street workout movements include pull ups, push-ups, muscle ups, front and back lever, and human flag.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What is streetlifting?</strong></p>\n<p>Street lifting is separate to street workouts, although both sports come from the same foundation of calisthenics. Street lifting is a strength sport that focuses on pure power using weighted calisthenics movements.</p>\n<p>The official sport of Street Lifting consists of two movements (pull up/chin up and dip). Some other street lifting competitions include weighted muscle ups. Similar to powerlifting, athletes get 3 attempts at both movements and the goal is to establish a max lift.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What is calisthenics?</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re interested in street workout or even street lifting, you probably already know that calisthenics is the OG of them all. Calisthenics is the art of mastering your own bodyweight through gymnastics and strength movements like pull ups, muscle ups, push ups, handstands, and dozens of other movements.</p>\n<p>Calisthenics is one of the oldest forms of exercise in the world and has been used by warriors, athletes, and regular people of all ages and backgrounds to get fit, strong, and healthy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What is the difference between street workout and calisthenics?</strong></p>\n<p>Street workout is deeply rooted in calisthenics. The main difference is that street workout has a distinct culture, and has to be done in public spaces (like parks) usually with other people. All street workout movements are originally calisthenics movements. If you choose to do calisthenics rather than street workout, you have the flexibility to train whenever and wherever you want.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Is calisthenics better than street workout?</strong></p>\n<p>Calisthenics and street workout are very similar in terms of movements. The only reason calisthenics might be preferable is that it’s more versatile. You don’t need to go to a street workout park or join other street workout fans to do a calisthenics workout. You can do calisthenics at home, in the gym, alone or with others – calisthenics is the ultimate “do anywhere” form of exercise.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Is calisthenics better than streetlifting?</strong></p>\n<p>What’s better, lifting weights or calisthenics? That really depends on your training goal. If your primary goal is extreme muscle mass (like a bodybuilder), or performance-based strength (like powerlifting) then you need to lift weights. If you want to achieve an athletic look, build functional strength, and have healthy joints then calisthenics is a great choice.</p>\n<p>Calisthenics can be done anywhere, any time, and doesn’t even need any equipment. If you do choose to add equipment to your calisthenics training, it’s light and portable (like parallettes, pull up bar or gymnastics rings). Calisthenics is the most versatile, portable, flexible form of strength training you can do.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Should I do street workout or street lifting?</strong></p>\n<p>If you crave the buzz of doing urban style workouts with a group of like-minded people, you may want to choose between street workout or street lifting. The main difference is the weighted aspect. Street workout is based around bodyweight movements. Street lifting is all weighted with the addition of weights and dipping belts. Street lifting also has fewer movements than street workout, which combines a variety of calisthenics movements with flowing transition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How to choose between street workout, street lifting, and calisthenics</strong></p>\n<p>If you don’t know how to choose between street workout, street lighting, and calisthenics, ask yourself these questions:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Do I want to train in a specific location or do I want to train anywhere, any time?</p>\n<p>Is my goal athletic functional fitness or sheer strength?</p>\n<p>Do I need to be able to train at home or on the go when I travel?</p>\n<p>Am I starting out in bodyweight training?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How to get started with calisthenics</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Get started with calisthenics by investing in a couple of basic high-quality pieces of calisthenics kit like parallettes and a pull up bar or rig. Follow Gravity Fitness for content and step-by-step tutorials on basic, intermediate, and advanced calisthenics moves. And just get stated!

So why did we go with wood (for the handles) and steel for the feet and uprights?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Why are wooden handles best for calisthenics equipment?</h2>\n<p><strong>Absorbs sweat</strong> – wood is a great choice for the handles of calisthenics kit because it absorbs sweat, unlike plastic (which gets slippy) or metal.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-slip</strong> – wooden handles are significantly more grippy than plastic or metal, making them a non-slip option for calisthenics and ring work<br><br><strong>Buffers impact</strong> – wood absorbs some of the impact on your hands and wrists, making training a more comfortable experience</p>\n<p><strong>Hand health</strong> – wood is gentler on your palms than plastic or metal (especially in cold temperatures) meaning fewer callouses</p>\n<p><strong>Feels good</strong> – simply put, wood just feels nicer than other materials, which is really important when you’re doing high rep work to drill your calisthenics movements<br><br></p>\n<h2>Wood vs steel vs plastic for calisthenics?</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re buying parallettes or gymnastics rings for yourself, or using them in the gym, you’ll notice a choice of materials. Plastic and wood are common choices for gymnastics rings, and wood or metal are most common for parallettes. We offer both items with quality wooden handles because we think it’s the best choice for grip, comfort, wrist and shoulder health, and hand care.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>How to choose the best calisthenics kit</h2>\n<p>If you’ve already tried plastic and metal calisthenics handles in the gym, you’ll know that wood is the best choice. If you’re buying for your own home gym kit, go straight for the premium option by choosing wooden handles gymnastics rings and parallettes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Are wooden rings best for gymnastics rings?&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Wooden gymnastics rings are far superior to plastic ones. Not only is wood more durable and better quality, but wood offers a non-slip, comfortable experience when your hands start to get slippery.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Best wooden handled parallettes calisthenics</h2>\n<p>We’ve recently relaunched our entire parallettes collection with a choice of three sizes: small “travellettes”, medium Pro parallettes, and long parallettes which are inspired by the classic gymnastics parallettes. They’re all made with quality wooden handles and fully-welded powder coated steel uprights and feet.</p>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https://gravity.fitness/\">parallettes</a> and gymnastics rings here so you can treat yourself to amazing quality, wooden handled calisthenics kit.</p>\n<p>For everything else you need for your bodyweight, calisthenics, and unconventional training sessions, take a look at the full <a href=\"https://gravity.fitness/\">Gravity Fitness store</a>.</p>"

   "detail": " <h1>Fitness myths: cardio doesn't work for weight loss</h1>\n<p>Is cardio useless for weight loss, or should you do cardio if you want to lose weight?</p>\n<p>The fitness space has been split down the middle on a few typical topics. Cardio training is one of them. Do we need to do cardio? Is it essential for weight loss? Or can cardio make it harder to lose weight?</p>\n<h2>&nbsp;How to lose weight</h2>\n<p>Every diet is different, but they all work in the same way. The underlying truth behind every successful weight loss story is a calorie deficit. That means creating a “gap” between how many calories your body uses, and how many calories you ingest. If you burn more calories than you eat, you’ll lose weight. If you eat fewer calories than you burn, you’ll lose weight. It doesn’t really matter how you achieve this calorie deficit.</p>\n<h2>Do you need to do cardio to lose weight?&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Many people believe that cardio is a good way to lose weight, and it’s easy to see why. After all, cardio exercise burns calories, and you need to “burn more calories than you eat” in order to lose weight. But there are a few problems with a cardio-centric approach to weight loss, and we’ll discuss those in a minute.</p>\n<h2>How many calories does cardio burn</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest problems with relying on cardio workouts to lose weight is that cardio may not actually use as many calories as you think. If you are a relatively small, light person, even an hour of steady cardio (like running) could only burn around 400 calories. When you consider that simply sitting around can burn 60+ calories in an hour, you can see why cardio isn’t that amazing at burning calories.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The heavier and larger you are, and the more intensely you exercise, the more calories you’ll burn. But this can have a knock-on effect on your appetite (making you want to eat more), your energy levels (making you more sedentary for the rest of the day) and your ability to workout the next day.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Can cardio make you gain weight</h2>\n<p>Cardio can’t make you gain weight exactly, but it can make losing weight harder. Make no mistake, actually performing cardio can’t cause your body to gain weight or hold on to bodyfat. But doing cardio can spike your appetite, lead to overeating, or make you too tired to exercise at a decent level of intensity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Think of it like this: you decide to “burn off” calories to lose weight, and commit to doing 1 hour of cardio every single day in order to burn around 450 calories. By day 4, you’re pretty tired. By day 6, you really need a rest. And on day 7, when you have your unplanned (but much needed) break from cardio, you barely move from the sofa. Not exactly a sustainable strategy.</p>\n<h2>3 reasons not to use cardio for weight loss</h2>\n<p><strong>It can increase appetite</strong></p>\n<p>Many people find that cardio – especially longer, slower cardio like jogging, swimming, or cycling – increases appetite and leads to overeating, which can very easily wipe out the calories you burned doing the cardio.</p>\n<p><strong>It can downregulate NEAT</strong></p>\n<p>NEAT stands for non-exercise activity thermogenesis, all the calories you burn simply from being active throughout the day. Standing, fidgeting, and moving around at home all count as NEAT. When you do a dedicated cardio session, you might decrease your NEAT either intentionally (because you deserve a long sit down) or subconsciously (because your body is preserving energy).</p>\n<p><strong>It’s an unsustainable strategy</strong></p>\n<p>You simply can’t keep burning calories every day in order to lose weight. At some point you’ll be tired, ill, or life will get in the way. This is the main argument for focusing more on nutrition to create that weight loss calorie deficit.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Does cardio have a place in weight loss</strong></p>\n<p>That said, there’s nothing wrong with cardio. In fact, it has plenty of benefits and definitely has a place in a general fitness healthy lifestyle. Even if you stop using cardio as a calorie burning outlet, you should still do some form of cardio throughout the week.</p>\n<p><strong>5 benefits of cardio</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Heart health – as the name suggests, cardiovascular exercise is great for your heart and entire CV system, which is so important when you consider that heart disease is a key mortality risk.</p>\n<p><strong>Reduce long-term health risks</strong> – doing some form of cardio can prevent high blood pressure, obesity, and other common health risks that can lead to health issues or even early death.</p>\n<p><strong>Improve bone density</strong> – strength training is best for bone health, but cardio can help boost and maintain bone strength too.</p>\n<p><strong>Help you sleep</strong> – low intensity cardio like walking can help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep for longer, which has a significant impact on your physical and mental health.</p>\n<p><strong>Boost your mood</strong> – find a form of cardio you love (see our list below) and enjoy it for some me-time, listening to an audiobook, enjoying the great outdoors, or just clearing your head.</p>\n<h2>9 things that count as “cardio”</h2>\n<p>A key thing to remember is that cardio isn’t just hopping on a gym cardio machine for 30 minutes or going for a run. Anything that gets your heart rate up and keeps it there counts as cardio.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here are 9 types of cardio you could try. But remember, if your goal is losing weight, don’t rely on cardio to burn off calories. Instead, control calories “in” by eating in a slight calorie deficit, and use exercise for health and enjoyment.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Walking</strong> – probably the most underrated form of cardio out there. Walking is low-impact, sustainable, and great for your health.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<strong>Hiking</strong> – hiking challenges your walking skills and allows you to get away from it all against the backdrop of nature.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<strong>Climbing</strong> – try an indoor climbing or bouldering session to get a cardio boost whilst having fun.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<strong>Dancing</strong> – all kinds of dance are amazing cardio, whether it’s a lesson, a class, dancing at home or going out and hitting the dancefloor</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<strong>Skipping</strong> – one of the simplest forms of cardio is jump rope. You won’t be able to do it for very long, but it’s good cardio for short bursts.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<strong>Gardening</strong> – yep, household chores like DIY and gardening can definitely count as cardio!</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<strong>Racket sports</strong> – tennis, badminton, squash and all racket sports are great cardio so if you love them, do them.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>\n<strong>Team sports</strong> – if you enjoy team sports, get involved. All team sports involve running and stop/start movements with your whole body – definitely cardio.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>\n<strong>Water sports</strong> – kayaking, canoeing, SUP and even a day out at the aqua park will all tick the cardio box.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Gravity Fitness believes fitness is for everybody.

   "detail": " <h1><strong><u>Equipment spotlight: steel mace</u></strong></h1>\n<p>The Steel Mace was originally used as a handheld medieval weapon, to cause and inflict brutal damage on an opponent on the opposing side of the battlefield. Now, however maces can be used in our training to help boost our joint health, our strength and our hand eye coordination. Once a weapon used for warfare, now the mace is a weapon used for strength, healing and conditioning.</p>\n<p>We love a good mace here at Gravity Fitness, as the steel mace embodies everything we are all about; alternative functional health and fitness. Using a mace can massively assist with unilateral or bilateral training i.e. training one side of the body or both. This can be a huge advantage when trying to correct any imbalances on one side of the body. Also when training across both sides of the body, we can focus on the mind to muscle connection along with coordination, to really build the focus we need to push ourselves further upon our training journey.</p>\n<p>Our steel maces come in varying weights allowing you to push yourself as far as you can! As a recommendation, always start out a little lighter than you think you will need, especially if you want to work on your shoulder mobility and perform any mace flows. This way you can focus on learning the patterns, as well as the holding of the mace itself, needed to master mace flow work. The weights we have our 4kg, 6kg, 8kg, 10kg and 12kg, all crafted in steel with a matte black finish and a textured surface to ensure a solid grip through your movements. I would recommend the 4kg or 6kg for shoulder work to begin with, and for any lower/weighted work I’d start at 8kg or 10kg.</p>\n<p>Once you have chosen your weapon, you need to learn to wield it! Any mace flow is going to be fantastic for your rotator cuff health. You can find a whole bunch online, from multiple sources. Always start slowly and patiently, master the coordination and the expected movements before starting to speed up the flow or to add weight to it! Mace Cossacks are a fantastic lower body strength and mobility move, allowing you to take the weight down over that one side securely and safely. Also a mace row from a boat pose will help strengthen your core an obliques massively. We can also work our upper body push movements with a mace. I personally love the mace shoulder press, as you can help with any shoulder strength imbalances, and use the weight with different bias in relation to your grip. For example, you can have the weight in front of, beside or behind the hand holding the mace. You can also choose to hold the weight further away from the body to add difficulty.</p>\n<p>Also, this side might go unfounded by a lot of other places, but here at Gravity Fitness, we like to embody the respect any functional practice deserves. Make sure you pay respect to the mace first. If you take care of the steel mace, it will take care of you as well. When it comes to training, making sure we pay respect to our training tools, as well as treating them well, will ensure they have the longest possible lifetime as well!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMiFGo5qlNM\">This video</a> from Gravity Fitness will take you through all things steel mace, and help you get to grips with how a mace handles! Outside of working on any flows and swings, you can use this quick workout to work on your full body strength with a mace:</p>\n<p><strong>-Mace Cossack Squats</strong> x 8 each side<br> <strong>-Mace Rows from seated boat position</strong> x 8 each side<br> <strong>-Mace Shoulder Press</strong> – switching positions of where the weight rests x 8 each position on each side<br> Repeat x 4 or as time allows</p>\n<p>Tag us on socials <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/gravity.fitness\">@gravity.fitness</a> to show us your steel mace flows, and what else you’re working on with a steel mace. Let us know if you have any questions, or if we can offer you any tips. And remember, just keep swinging!</p>"

   "detail": " <h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Fitness tracking for peak fitness</u></strong></h1>\n<p>Fitness can be built, started, continued, tested, tracked and measured at any age. But what defines the measurements of peak fitness? And how can we, as athletes, keep track of those measurements? What can we do to measure progress?</p>\n<p>Well let’s go through some of those parameters, break them down and following that I’ll provide some exercises you can test and track for each category. Also remember peak fitness is about how you feel, unless you’re a serious professional athlete. So building a well rounded routine, that pushes all the planes of movement is the way to go. And remember to keep scaling up your training to progress. Different ages in training can be measured in different ways, so I’ll cover those age ranges as well. Below are the categories of tracking.</p>\n<p><strong>1) <u>Skill/technique</u></strong> – This benchmark of fitness is about learning and practice. Skill and technique are about correct form and application. Making sure we perform things correctly to improve. We can use hand eye coordination, balance and cognitive functions, as well as more sports specific training methods.<br> <br> For skill and technique, if we are training as an older athlete, we can work on flexibility and time under tension, using longer time periods throughout the form of a particular exercise to keep correct engagement. If a younger athlete, you can track skill and technique using sporting training methods – throwing and catching and contact sports. For the older generations, they can still practice these, but equally can incorporate hobbies such as golf and cricket.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <br><strong> 2) <u>Speed</u></strong> – Does exactly what it says on the tin. Speed is all about the rapid movement of the body – the 0-100 if you like. The velocity and acceleration with which we can perform certain movements, by recruiting and building fast twitch muscle fibres. Here we can use exercises that cross both sides of the body that involve rapid crossing.<br> <br> For speed testing, we can use the bleep test or a skipping rope for older trainers, or quick jumping movements, like side steps or jump squats for younger athletes. For those who are older, speed training has been proven to be hugely beneficial, as this helps improve reaction speed and times, slowing aging significantly. For younger athletes this leads to much improved performance. <br> <br> <strong>3) <u>Power</u></strong> – Power is speed in combination with force. This is performing high velocity movements at maximum level – think of a clap push up for example. Power is like the total exertion the body can produce at rapid speeds.<br> <br> For power training benchmarks, we need to make sure that joints are strong and protected. I would think about reducing impact for older athletes. For younger trainers clap push ups, or box jumps would be great here. <br> <br><strong> 4) <u>Force/Strength</u></strong> – This is the maximum ‘strength’ application. This is not about repetitions or endurance. Think about pushing against a wall to try and push it over.&nbsp; This is where maximal load comes into play -our one rep maxes, etc.<br> <br> Force is good to measure and test in a controlled environment – this is where we want to test our 1RM or one rep max. Gyms are good for these tests, as we can load up weight safely. Remember to grease the groove for these movements first i.e. practice the body patterns with little to no weight first. Older and younger athletes can use the same exercises here, it just depends on what you’re pushing for. <br> <br> <strong>5) <u>Muscle hypertrophy</u></strong> – Building muscle size is what comes from hypertrophy. We use muscle hypertrophy to not only change our body composition but to provide our joints and skeletal system with muscular support. To build the size of the muscle itself. <br> <br> Muscular hypertrophy is building the muscle size. Muscles cant count so you want between 30-40 seconds under tension and be struggling with the last 2 reps. Try and improve the numbers and shrink the time frame to complete those numbers. We can use any exercise here that can be performed in an easily scalable environment, such as the gym. We can choose a bench press, shoulder raise, side bends, thrusters, etc. Regardless of age, these can be trained using whatever you feel comfortable doing. For older trainers, potentially keep the movements more simple. Resistance training is hugely beneficial for older adults as it helps to slow the signs of aging, such as bone density, cognitive and nervous system function. <br> <strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><strong> 6) <u>Muscular endurance</u></strong>– With muscular endurance, we can test our reps performance. And our ability to push ourselves to the limit, using the muscular system specifically. Think working to failure.<br> <br> With muscular endurance, we can pick a couple of exercises and rep them out as much as possible. Exercise choice depends on personal preference. Push ups and pull ups, squats and deadlifts tend to work well here. Set an amount of reps, then try and better it next time you test your endurance. Remember the higher, the better. <br> <br> <strong>7) <u>Anaerobic capacity</u></strong>– This is synonymous with maximum heart rate and using our anaerobic energy system to push ourselves without oxygen enriched blood for intense work, normally, shorter distances. This improves our circulatory efficiency.<br> <br> For anaerobic capacity we can use sprint style training to move quickly over a slightly extended period or distance. Sprinting for younger athletes and high intensity circuit training for older trainers would work well here.<br> &nbsp;<br> <strong>8) <u>Maximal aerobic capacity</u></strong>– For work that involves the respiratory system and oxygen enriched blood to help us work over longer periods at maximum effort. Controlling breathing and training ourselves to the maximal effort we can.<br> <br> For maximal aerobic capacity, we need to improve the efficiency of our oxygen intake. Whether as an older or younger athlete it’s about regulating, and training breath work. Just remember your age will vary your maximal ability to start with. So start at a level that is right for you.&nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>9) <u>Long-duration training</u></strong> – This is working at the submaximal level for extended periods of time. This is how most people perceive cardio training.<br></p>\n<p>For long duration training, the parameters are pretty similar whether and older or younger athlete. Set distance benchmarks for cycling, swimming or running over a longer time frame, and then try to reduce that timeframe over the same distance, until you reach your goal.</p>\n<p>In summary, there are many different facets in which you can test your fitness, just make sure you st up controlled parameters and safety to perform them. A well rounded training routine is going to give you the best results, especially when you push it to the limits!</p>\n<p>You can send us your fitness challenges on socials <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/gravity.fitness\">@gravity.fitness</a> and why not use some of the Gravity Fitness battle ropes to test your endurance?

We refer to the body of a Greek god to mean a physique that’s strong, balanced, lean and athletic but not over complicated. The question is, how should you train and eat to get as close to a Greek god body as your genetics will allow?<br><br></p>\n<h2><strong>5 features of a Greek god body</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Balanced physique</strong> – top to bottom, with no overpowering body parts</p>\n<p><strong>Broad shoulders</strong> – lean, wide shoulders with an athletic look</p>\n<p><strong>Deep, developed back</strong> – distinctive muscle density and separation</p>\n<p><strong>Tapered waist</strong> – a V-taper with muscled abs and obliques</p>\n<p><strong>Big legs and calves</strong> –balanced quads, hamstrings and calves</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>How to train for the body of a Greek god</strong></h2>\n<p>To get the body of a Greek god, you need to build balanced body proportions and a rugged kind of depth to your muscle. This look isn’t about being shredded or ripped. It’s about building a big, lived-in body that looks like it could take on any physical challenge.</p>\n<p>Functional workouts and unconventional training styles are great for building a Greek god look to your physique. Traditional barbell and weights machines can play a part – usually to fill-in smaller muscle groups and balance out the whole look. But your Greek god workouts should centre around gymnastics, calisthenics, loaded carries and odd objects like <span><a href=\"https://gravity.fitness/collections/all/products/gravity-fitness-heavy-duty-sandbag-20-50kg\">sandbags</a></span>, <span><a href=\"https://gravity.fitness/collections/all/products/gravity-fitness-strong-sandbag-50kg-150kg\">atlas stones</a></span>, and sleds.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>10 exercises worthy of a Greek god workout</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Pull Ups &amp; Weighted pull ups</strong><br><br>Pull ups are widely regarded as the holy grail of back builders. Take your pull ups to the next level by adding weight with a <span><a href=\"https://gravity.fitness/collections/all/products/gravity-fitness-advanced-4-in-1-heavy-duty-workout-dip-belt\">dipping belt</a></span>. It’s no surprise that heavy pull ups will build serious mass throughout the upper body, especially in the lats and rhomboids.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dips &amp; Weighted Dips<br><br></strong>Dips are one of the best upper body push exercises in existence and have stood the test of time, building the triceps, chest, front delts and even the rhomboid muscles in your back. Add weight with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gravity.fitness/collections/all/products/gravity-fitness-advanced-4-in-1-heavy-duty-workout-dip-belt\">dipping belt</a>&nbsp;to build even more strength and size.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Hollow body holds<br><br></strong>An often under utilised exercise which will build a rock solid and functional core. A strong core is an essential component of the Greek god body.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Hanging Leg Raises<br><br></strong>Another fundamental exercise in building a strong and define core to give you that Greek god body. Not only will this exercise build rock solid abs both visibly and internally, you will also build god like grip strength at the same time.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Farmers walks<br><br></strong>Any kind of weighted walk or carry will build rugged traps and serious back density as well as build leg thickness and strength. Load up a set of farmers handles, or use heavy kettlebells to walk at least 25m for reps.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sandbag carry and load<br><br></strong><a href=\"https://gravity.fitness/collections/all/products/gravity-fitness-heavy-duty-sandbag-20-50kg\">Sandbags are an amazing odd-object training tool</a> that you can use for squats, lunges, cleans, overhead press – pretty much anything. We suggest you take your sandbag for a walk, by doing a carry and load-to-platform challenge with a heavy bag.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Shuttle Runs &amp; Plyometric Training<br><br></strong>The Greeks where not only&nbsp;muscular and strong, they were also fast an agile. Their physiques weren’t there for “show” these guys where absolute machines. Whilst you could build a Greek looking body without being physically fit it wouldn’t be a true Greek God Physique.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Bodyweight or Weighted Squats<br><br></strong>Another key component to the Greek God body is thick and strong legs. Squats are another fundamental exercise that has stood the test of time. However there is more to squats that just weight back squats, try bodyweight squats, pistol squats, sissy squats for better leg development and strength.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Handstand Push ups<br><br></strong>Want big shoulders like&nbsp;a Greek god? Being able to push your bodyweight up in the handstand position is a true measure of strength and will build boulder like shoulders in no time. Haven’t got the handstand fully locked in yet? Use a wall.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Mace &amp; Indian Club Training<br><br></strong>The Spartans and the Greeks often trained for hours with swords and shields to build their fighting prowess.

   "detail": " <h1><strong>Do you need a morning ritual to achieve your goals?</strong></h1>\n<p>The concept of a ‘morning ritual’ has swept social in the past few years, with everyone from athletes to entrepreneurs swearing by their early hours routine. But is it actually necessary? Does every morning have to start with the same routine if you want to reach your goals? And what can you do instead of having a morning ritual?</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Why is having a morning ritual so popular?</strong></h2>\n<p>We can’t be sure, but it feels like the current hype around morning rituals started during lockdown. Which would make sense – routines give us a sense of control and stability which is comforting when everything else is so up in the air. There are a lot of reasons behind the popularity of morning rituals:</p>\n<p>Structure – by starting your day with a familiar routine, you get things off to a positive start and are more likely to stick to your plan for the day.</p>\n<p>Time saving – a set routine in the morning ensures that important things get done before distractions crowd in to the day.</p>\n<p>Productivity – some people feel that by tackling important tasks early, you free up mental energy and time for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>Mental wellbeing - many morning rituals incorporate things like meditation, gratitude journaling, time in nature, or exercise, which are great mental wellness tools.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Physical health – morning rituals often include healthy things like drinking water, getting some steps in, eating a healthy breakfast, which are all great for physical health and may encourage you to make healthier choices during the day.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>What are the pros and cons of having a morning ritual?</strong></h2>\n<p>So those are some of the plus sides to having a morning ritual in place. But what about the downsides? Are there any? And if so, why isn’t anyone really talking about this?</p>\n<p>We’re big fans of balance here at Gravity Fitness, and we think that the truth is usually found somewhere in the middle of any debate. The same goes for morning rituals. Once a morning ritual becomes too rigid, inflexible, or simply stops working for you, it’s no longer a benefit. And if you start to rely on it too much, it’s a crutch.</p>\n<p>Rigid routines – if your morning ritual is inflexible and can’t soften to cope with changes in environment, location, partnerships, or lifestyle then it’s no longer a benefit.</p>\n<p>Peer pressure – if you’re feeling the pressure to adopt a specific morning routine, or you think one element of your routine is actually stressful to you, don’t do it.</p>\n<p>Sleep/stress – a morning routine is meant to make life easier and help you start the day feeling calm and focused. If you’re trying to get too much done by cramming lots into a morning routine, it could have the opposite effect.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>How to put together a morning ritual that works for you</strong></h2>\n<p>Most people could benefit from some kind of morning structure, whether you want to call it a ritual or a routine. Here’s how to create one that works for you (and can flex as your situation changes).<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Identify your priorities</strong></p>\n<p>What's most important for you in the morning. Is it exercise, journalling, getting outside, meditation, goal setting, or simply a slow and calm start to the day?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Keep it simple&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t try to cram your ritual with every trending wellness topic under the sun. Pick 2- things that work for your priorities, do them for a few weeks, and adapt or add to them if necessary.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Make it sustainable</strong></p>\n<p>Just like your training and nutrition, your morning routine needs to work for you wherever you are. Will these little morning habits work on holiday, on Christmas Day, or on the busiest day of your working week?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Be flexible</strong></p>\n<p>Have a basic, plan B version of your morning routine which you can achieve in 3 minutes even in the middle of the apocalypse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Adapt as necessary</strong></p>\n<p>From time to time, assess your morning ritual. Is it still hitting the spot? Do you still need and enjoy it? Does anything need to go – or be added?</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>How to cope without having a morning ritual</strong></h2>\n<p>If all of this morning ritual stuff sounds ridiculous to you, no worries. You don’t need one. Instead, do what comes naturally, which might include setting daily goals or priorities, using to-do lists, taking short breaks during the day to move about, and getting enough sleep.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Are morning rituals just a fad?</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;When it comes to nutrition, training, and wellness in general, there’s no one size fits all. You have to find tools that help you look after yourself in a way that works for you. It’s the same with morning rituals. Some people will thrive on them, others will find them restrictive or unnecessary. As long as you’re starting your day in a way that feels physically and emotionally healthy (rather than letting external pressures of life dictate what you do and how you feel), you crack on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"www.gravity.fitness\">Gravity Fitness store</a> for functional fitness and calisthenics tools to help you move your body your way, wherever and whenever you want to train.</p>"

From motivational memes to household-name slogans like Just Do It, the assumption seems to be that if you want it hard enough, you’ll get it done. But what happens to the idea of just doing it when you don’t particularly want to?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like it or not, motivation and willpower aren’t reliable tools - they take a lot of mental effort and will come and go. Luckily, there’s a much better way to get into the training and healthy eating mindset. Let’s talk about how to get into the flow of consistency.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The downside of relying on motivation</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span>\n</h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motivation is temporary – it can come and go depending on your mood. And whilst it can be great for that first rush of enthusiasm, motivation rarely lasts long enough to keep you training in the longer term.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s usually external – motivation is often tied to external factors or short-lived goals, rather than intrinsic values-based drivers that last longer.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It goes up and down – motivation isn’t steady, and can be impacted by distractions and stresses. If you rely on motivation for your fitness outcomes, you might get stuck going one step forward, two steps back.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Make a commitment to yourself</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commitment doesn’t mean obsessively tied to an unrealistic fitness routine. It’s a promised to yourself and an investment in your health. Making a commitment to training and healthy eating will hold you gently accountable, and help you focus on the bigger picture.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How to make fitness a habit</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If motivation is fleeting, habits are a solid foundation. And that’s why it’s much better to make training, healthy eating, regular walks, and other goals a habit rather than waiting to feel inspired. Once a habit is in place, it’s second nature like brushing your teeth.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Habits lead to consistent actin, which is crucial for long-term success with your training and diet. Forget the ups and downs of motivation or the hard graft of will power. Embed simple healthy habits that you can stick to, and this stuff will start feeling easy.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Discipline vs willpower for fitness goals</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s plenty of research to show that willpower takes a lot of mental energy and can quickly become draining. That’s why people who use willpower to stick to an unrealistic diet or training plan often reach breaking point and fall off the wagon.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discipline is a deeper sense of integrity that is tied to your core values. Being disciplined gives you the opportunity to make choices that align with your goals, values, and how you want to show up in the world.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Why consistency is key for health and fitness</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span>\n</h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll often hear fitness experts say that consistency trumps everything. The best training plan in the world, they say, won’t work unless you actually do it. And that takes consistency. Consistency is the act of showing up and making certain choices time and time again – not just once or twice, but for years.<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consistency helps you establish a routine that’s easy to remember (no motivation or willpower needed), and leads to progress over time. Combine consistency with the habits we’ve already mentioned, and you become a person for whom being active and eating well is a lifestyle choice. No questions, no doubts – it just is what you do.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Is it OK to use motivational quotes as fitness inspo?</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span>\n</h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re not saying motivation has no place at all in a fitness lifestyle. It can be a powerful way to kickstart new behaviours and get you excited about the journey ahead. Just remember that it rarely lasts, and it takes a lot of mental energy. The best approach is finding a deep, intrinsic reason that resonates with you, then using habits and building consistency so fitness and nutrition become second nature.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gravity Fitness is dedicated to giving you training tools, education and inspiration that will help you get started on your fitness routine and keep going.

   "detail": " <p><strong>5 ways your ice bath is ruining your goals</strong></p>\n<p>Here’s why that ice bath habit might be doing more harm than good.</p>\n<p>Ice baths and cold water immersion are enjoying a moment. Fans of the habit say it helps them recover from training, get focused, and even sleep better. But what does the science say… and can ice baths be detrimental to your health and fitness goals?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Why do people take ice baths</strong></p>\n<p>The term “ice bath” has taken on a flexible meaning. These days, the practice can range from literally filling a purpose-made tub with ice and cold water and sitting in it, to taking a dip in cold water. But why do people do it?</p>\n<p>Most ice bathers (is that what we call them?) do it for two reasons: workout recovery, and mental clarity. People who take ice baths to recover from training say it reduces inflammation and improves blood flow. People who do ice baths for mental wellbeing feel it has a positive impact on the vagus nerve, reducing stress and boosting clarity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What is the science behind ice baths</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Are ice baths scientifically proven to help you recover from training and lead a calmer lifestyle? The research is mixed. Latest reviews suggest that cold water and ice can temporarily reduce pain, but may actually delay muscle healing. And, whilst it seems logical that the “shrinking” effect of cold also reduces inflammation, there’s little proof that this has a long-term impact on recovery.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There’s a whole movement built around cold water immersion and ice-related therapy. Wim Hof would have you believe that it holds the key to exercise recovery, long life, and all good things in between. But the science has yet to find a definitive answer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As with most things, balance is key. If you enjoy an ice bath and genuinely feel it fits into your day with no negative effects - crack on. But don’t let ice baths become a rigid habit that rules your life. And, if it stops feeling good, don’t carry on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Is an ice bath more harm than good</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re thinking about adding ice baths to your health and wellness lifestyle, there’s more to think about than “does it help exercise recovery”? You should also think about the logistics of it and what it might be keeping you from doing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>5 ways ice baths might ruin your fitness goals</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. You hate doing it</strong></p>\n<p>If you really don’t enjoy ice baths or cold water dips, don’t do it. You know what they say, the best habit are the ones you can show up and do consistently for years. Even if it turns out that ice baths are amazing for recovery, you’re not going to do it if you don’t enjoy it. Find something enjoyable that contributes to recovery instead.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2. You’re skipping on sleep</strong></p>\n<p>Are you setting an alarm to do an ice bath before the rest of your morning routine? Are you missing out on sleep in order to get it done? Maybe it would be better to have the extra 30 minutes sleep instead. Morning routines are only healthy if you can actually fit them in.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>3. You feel tied to the rigid routine</strong></p>\n<p>Do you feel honour-bound to carry on with the ice bath habit even though you really don’t enjoy it? Has the routine started to feel like it’s running your life? Then don’t do it. All healthy habits should be a positive addition to your life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>4. You give up other habits to do it</strong></p>\n<p>If you’ve replaced all other methods of recovery with ice baths, it’s time to rethink your approach. Good recovery includes sleep, rest, stretching or mobility, hydration, good nutrition, and gentle activity. You can’t skimp on everything else and expect ice baths to work magic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>5. It’s keeping you from other aspects of training</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re consistently missing conditioning sessions/mobility work/skills practice in favour of ice baths, the ice bath is probably ruining your goals. Don’t cut workouts short in order to get in the ice bath, or skip key sessions in favour of cold-water immersion. Do the fundamentals first, then add ice bath therapy if you have the spare time.</p>\n<p>Check out the Gravity Fitness store for the world’s leading calisthenics and unconventional training equipment so you can train your way – any time, anywhere, any way you choose.</p>"

   "published": "April 25, 2023",
   "detail": " <h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>What does it take to be an ‘Ancestral’ athlete?</u></strong></h1>\n<p>When we think of the word ‘Ancestral’, it normally provokes strength, hunting, fight or flight responsiveness and adrenaline. Man vs Beast in a battle for survival….Normally it would have the connotation of living on the knife’s edge. But I’d beg to differ.</p>\n<p>When I think of ‘Ancestral’ I think of less complication, less distraction, more focus on the natural and above all focusing on keeping things functional.</p>\n<p>We can strip out the distractions, the complications and focus on the task ahead. I think for a lot of athletes that’s the appeal of training and competition – to be able to drop out all other distraction and apply pure focus to achieve their potential. But how can you get into a similar place with your state of mind and your training?</p>\n<p>Whether labelling a more honed, intelligent and healthy version of yourself as ‘Ancestral’ or not, you can boil down the parameters for your journey into a few simple guidelines. I’ve based these on some similar lessons from Ben Greenfield. I’m going to go through each one and hopefully help you to become a more ‘Ancestral’ athlete.<br><br></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><strong><u>Adjust your perspective</u></strong></h3>\nLook at things in a different light with a different approach. If you have been training a certain way for a while, explore other options and methods. Make sure you explore every plane of your body movement.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>\n<strong><u>Get used to being uncomfortable</u></strong>&nbsp;</h3>\nPushing your body to it’s limits, and beyond, is the way to progress and establish solid gains. Make sure every session improves on the previous session in one way or another – whether through rest, reps, time under tension, etc.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong><u>Be comfortable <br></u></strong></h3>\n&nbsp;Before you say it, no - this is not contrary to point 2. You need to create an environment and surroundings for you to feel comfortable in to be able to produce your best, and to limit distraction. With a solid grounding you can push yourself even further.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>\n<strong><u>Work Hard</u></strong>&nbsp;</h3>\nyou’ll have to be prepared to put in the hard graft. Nothing worth having ever comes easy, and you have to start somewhere. One day what you consider impossible will become your warm up!<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong><u>Make time for love <br></u></strong></h3>\nLove in life takes many forms. But you have to find time for that enrichment and nourishment of the soul too. Be open, meet people, find love. It’s better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all. Take time to spend with your loved ones, as more often than not they can pus you further than you ever thought you could go, and they will always be there to support you.</li>\n<li>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><u><strong>Eat natural</strong></u></h3>\nThis one is definitely one of the most important. Try and eat as much natural wholefood as possible. Pre cook and prepare meals for ease and time saving. Use plenty of green veggies, fruit and grains. Anyone that tells you fruit makes you fat is an idiot. Whether plant based or not, derive your protein from natural sources and eat plenty of it!<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong><u>Empty the trash <br></u></strong></h3>\nStrip back what distracts you and feels unnecessary. This can take many forms and contexts. Start by listing what these might be so you can analyse them with care and attention. With access to so much these days, this can be quite a difficult one to practice, but if it doesn’t bring you joy, don’t do it.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong><u>Science backed is always the way</u></strong></h3>\n– Always follow scientific proven methods, not the latest fads on social media. Get used to the boring reading of scientific journals, as they are a wonderful source of research backed information. Keep focused on what has already been proven and established.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong><u>Keep the mind clear</u></strong></h3>\nAgain, strip back what distracts you mentally. Practising mindfulness, deep breathing techniques and meditation can all help to manage mental pathways. These sorts of techniques can also help to manage your emotional state as well.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong><u>Don’t stress</u></strong></h3>\nThis one can often get away from us with how instant life can be. But just remember you’re a human being in a world filled with other human beings all just trying to get by. Hold others to the same standards and forgiveness you would hold to yourself.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are just a few of the methods you can use to live the most ‘Ancestral’ life that you can. Strip things back to basics and keep it simple, whether in life or your training. At the <a href=\"http://www.gravity.fitness/shop\">Gravity Fitness Store</a> we have equipment that can help you perform the most basic and functional movements, so you don’t have to worry about keeping your training ‘Ancestral’!</p>\n<p>Tag us on socials <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/gravity.fitness\">@gravity.fitness</a> to show us your ‘Ancestral’ living!</p>"

   "detail": " <h1>\n<strong>Safety 101 for cold water swimming</strong>&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>How to be safe open water swimming so you get the most out of your chilly new hobby.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cold water swimming is having a moment, and we’re here for it – but we also want everyone to stay safe. Thanks to the inspiring adventures of Ross Edgley, the growing popularity of Wim Hof, and a mounting body of scientific evidence about cold water therapy, there’s never been more interest in outdoor swimming.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot to think about when you go cold water swimming. Water temperature, air temperature, tides and currents, underwater hazards and other water users are just the start.</p>\n<h2><strong>Don’t swim alone</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The first and most obvious safety rule for cold water swimming has to be never swim alone. Yes, we know, organising a swim buddy is just one more thing to do when all you want to do is get out there. But it should be a non-negotiable for your safety. Even the most familiar body of water can change with weather, tides, currents, temperature and time of year.</p>\n<h2><strong>Wetsuit or not?</strong></h2>\n<p>Some open water swimmers insist on swimming without a wetsuit all year round, because they want to feel the water on their skin. Others will always wear a wetsuit so they can train properly. The choice is yours, just be aware of the pros and cons. A wetsuit will give you buoyancy and some protection from the cold (but don’t rely on it – you’re still at risk of hypothermia). No wetsuit makes it quicker to get into warm clothes afterwards.</p>\n<h2><strong>Tides, temperatures and more</strong></h2>\n<p>Learn as much as you can about the things that can change lakes, rivers, ponds, pools and the sea. Never underestimate nature. Use resources like the RNLI, Coastguard, lifeguard and open water swimming groups to understand how tides, currents, rip tides, high and low water, wave height, swell, and temperatures change.</p>\n<h2><strong>Understand water conditions</strong></h2>\n<p>If you swim in the sea, make it your mission to understand tides and currents. If you’re going to be swimming in fresh water, learn what you can about temperature, water depth, and underwater hazards. No two bodies of water are the same, and there’s a big difference between a lake, a tidal river, and the sea.</p>\n<h2><strong>Common sense swimming rules</strong></h2>\n<p>Check the weather before you go. Take plenty of warm clothing for afterwards. Pack a hot thermos. Always tell someone where you’re going. Pay attention to lifeguard flags, buoys and other markers. Swim parallel to the shore rather than out and back.</p>\n<h2><strong>Avoid hypothermia</strong></h2>\n<p>Cold water swimming is, well, cold. And hypothermia is a real thing, even in water that doesn’t seem especially cold. Learn to recognise the signs of hypothermia in others, and be realistic about your limits (it’s difficult to spot it in yourself). Know that wind and air temperature can have as much of an impact as water temperature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;And be serious about getting warm as soon as possible after your swim – the chill can catch you off-guard after a few minutes once the blood starts circulating normally again. Put a warm hat, socks and gloves on first then quickly get dressed with layers and get out of the wind.</p>\n<h2><strong>Be visible in the water</strong></h2>\n<p>Never swim without a brightly coloured swim cap and safety buoy. A swimmer is very small and almost completely submerged, so don’t expect other water users like boats, light craft, and jet skis to be able to see you. If you swim early in the morning, consider tucking a light stick under your goggles strap.</p>\n<h2><strong>Know what to do in an emergency</strong></h2>\n<p>We hope nothing will ever happen, but do you know who to contact if it does? Call the Coastguard on 999 (yes, they’re an emergency service).</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>Prepare for post-swim</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Phew, you’re out! Don’t let that exhilarating post-swim feeling stop you from getting warm, dry, and out of the elements. Swim hat off, woolly hat on. Now put warm socks on. Then you can take off your swim suit and get dressed.</p>\n<p>Prioritise layers rather than one thick outfit – that way you’ll get warm even if it takes a while to get dressed with chilly fingers.

   "detail": " <h1><strong>Ancient forms of training: physical culture in Russia</strong></h1>\n<p>Sport and fitness formed the foundations of the USSR, what can we learn from Russia’s approach to physical culture?</p>\n<h2><strong>The history of Russia and the Soviet Union</strong></h2>\n<p>Writing about the physical culture of Russia isn’t straightforward, because the country we now call Russia has formerly part of the Soviet Union and USSR. The Soviet Union was a state made up of 15 republics. After its collapse in 1991, the republics became independent countries. Russia is one of these countries and was a core part of the Soviet Union (Moscow was the USSR capital).</p>\n<h2><strong>What was the physical culture of ancient Russia</strong></h2>\n<p>OK, history lesson over (we’ll stay in our lane!) As Russia was such an important part of the USSR, its approach to sport and fitness can be considered fundamental to physical culture in that vast part of the world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Physical culture was a key part of Soviet culture. Before the revolution, sports were really only accessible to more privileged classes of society. The post-revolution Soviet state was keen to promote general fitness for everyone, but without the sense of competition. State funding from the new Soviet state went towards everyday functional exercise including track &amp; field and calisthenics.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>The history of calisthenics in the Soviet Union</strong></h2>\n<p>The Soviet Union felt that healthy bodies were a symbol of disciplined, healthy minds. Sport and fitness under the Soviet Union were very much about training together to create a healthy community, rather than individuals. Outdoor group sports and workouts were a big part of the USSR.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Workouts were woven into daily life, with everyone encouraged to do short bouts of spontaneous exercise – at work, at school, on your way from A to B. Radio stations ran regular exercise broadcasts for children and pensioners. A programme called “Industrial Gymnastics” ran at all workplaces under strict instruction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Calisthenics was a hugely important part of Russian culture, and this can be seen in modern-day Russia. Russia has a street workout culture that has produced top calisthenics athletes and gymnastics from grassroots to elite levels.</p>\n<h2><strong>How did ancient Russia test fitness?</strong></h2>\n<p>Under the Soviet Union, a nationwide fitness programme was rolled out from 1931 until the collapse of the USSR. It featured distance running, swimming, push ups, pull ups, rope climbing, and shot putt and was taught in schools and Universities across Russia and the Soviet Union. Versions for adults swapped out running for speed walking. The national programme prioritised functional movements, outdoor fitness, and practical exercises rather than aesthetics or muscularity.</p>\n<p>Later on, when commercial gyms became popular in other parts of the world, Russia largely stuck with bodyweight training and calisthenics. That’s not to say you can’t go to the gym and use fixed weight resistance machines in Russia – of course you can, but it’s much less popular than in other parts of the world. Russian physical culture was built on bodyweight, calisthenics, and gymnastics. The basics still reign supreme.</p>\n<h2><strong>Famous sports from ancient Russia</strong></h2>\n<p>Russia in the Soviet era produced a lot of great gymnasts, weightlifter, and wrestlers. Russians were also known for track &amp; field events, as well as some team sports like ice hockey.</p>\n<p>But the sports most closely linked with Russia are calisthenics, gymnastics, and (these days) street workouts. This is partly because of the sociocultural history of the region, partly because of calisthenics roots, and partly down to how Russians view gymnastics quite differently to other countries.</p>\n<p>We agree that calisthenics and bodyweight workouts should be accessible to everyone. After all, it makes sense – all you need is your own bodyweight and maybe a pull up rack, gymnastics rings, or parallettes.</p>\n<p>If you fancy introducing a bit of Soviet spirit into your own training, check out the Gravity store for calisthenics kit then get going!</p>"

This form of training shows up in ancient Greece, India, China (in fact, we’re written an entire blog series about that).&nbsp;</schemaplus_faq_answer></p>\n<p>The 19th Century was a big moment for modern calisthenics. German researchers, Friedrich Ludwig Jahn and Adolf Spiess, popularised gymnastic movements as a form of physical fitness in the 1800s, and Catherine Beecher wrote a book called “Physiology and Calisthenics for Schools and Families” in 1857.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;These days, calisthenics shows up in military fitness, bodybuilding, gymnastics, and CrossFit. All hail the mighty bodyweight exercise!</p>\n<h2><strong><schemaplus_faq_question>Who is considered the master of calisthenics?</schemaplus_faq_question></strong></h2>\n<p><schemaplus_faq_answer>Roger Jiménez has the unofficial title the Catalan king of calisthenics. He’s a former climber with a load of titles and a trademark clean, flowing style. Jiménez started doing calisthenics in 2014 and won a major competition just a year later. In his first year of calisthenics he also won an international meet in Madrid and qualified for the Super Final in Russia where he came 11th. The following year he came 4th. Jiménez won the Battle of the Bars in 2018 and went on to the World Championships where he came a close 2nd.

Hristov was Bulgarian national champion in 2020 and came 2nd at the world championship in Moscow and the world cup in Hong Kong in 2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Hannibal for King</strong> is a major name in YouTube calisthenics and is credited with bringing bodyweight training back into the mainstream over the past 25 years. At 44, he’s older than a lot of the current pro athletes in the field but his longevity in the sport (and his compelling rags-to-riches backstory) is part of what makes him so motivating.<span><br></span>&nbsp;<span><br></span><strong>Vadym Oleynik</strong> calls himself the strongest calisthenics athlete in the world, and he’s a sought-after coach and judge as well as holding several world championship titles. His feats of strength include incredible weighted muscle-ups that blend calisthenics with sheer strength sports.</p>\n<p><strong>Chris “Tatted Strength” Luera</strong> is another story of redemption with calisthenics at its heart. He went from being a prisoner to a 3 x WCO Battle of the Bars title holder. His story is inspiring and his calisthenics skills have earned him the unofficial title of one of the best calisthenics athletes in the world.</p>\n<p>If you want static hold inspo, check out calisthenics athlete <strong>Osvaldo Lugones.

Calisthenics, along with wrestling, combat sports, and throwing sports, were a core part of Spartan military training.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>500 B. C – Chinese monks</strong></h3>\n<p>In the 500s B.C., Shaolin Monks in China trained in calisthenics to protect their monasteries from looters. Perhaps not the zen solution you’d expect, but certainly a powerful one. Calisthenics helped the monks become fast, strong, and hard to beat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Early 1800s – calisthenics in education</strong></h3>\n<p>German gymnasts and educators <span><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn\">Friedrich Ludwig Jahn</a></span> and Adolf Spiess popularised calisthenics and <span><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/sports/gymnastics\">gymnastics</a></span>, particularly in the education of women. It took off most notably in Sweden thanks to <span><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Per-Henrik-Ling\">Per Henrik Ling</a></span> who pioneered the teaching of physical education.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>1800s – calisthenics for women</strong></h3>\n<p>In the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, calisthenics was one form of exercise deemed acceptable for women in the UK (along with dancing, horse riding, and walking).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>\n<strong>1820s – British army</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>The British military caught on to the idea of formalising fitness for recruits in the early 1800s, and began using calisthenics (and weight training) around 1820.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>1857 - Physiology and Calisthenics for Schools and Families</strong></h3>\n<p>Catherine Beecher wrote the Physiology and Calisthenics for Schools and Families in 1857 in the USA. It was intended for women, but became so popular her ideas were adopted widely by all ages and sexes.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>1892 – The Manual of Calisthenics</strong></h3>\n<p>In the USA, military man Herman Koehler who was working at West Point, wrote and published his “<span><a href=\"https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Portals/7/combat-studies-institute/csi-books/a-historical-review-and-analysis-of-army-physical-readiness-training-and-assessment.pdf\">Manual of Calisthenics</a></span>,” which became one of the first official Army publications to standardise physical training.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>1892 to now - US Army</strong></h3>\n<p>The US military uses calisthenics as a key part of its basic fitness tests, recruitment, and training.&nbsp; US Army soldiers do at least two fitness tests a year, including push ups, sits ups and running.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>1930s – state schools in Australia</strong></h3>\n<p>Calisthenics was introduced into Australian Victorian State Schools throughout the 1930s, and quickly became popular across the country. These days there are 100s of calisthenics clubs across Australia.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>1950-80s – Jack Lelanne and American TV</strong></h3>\n<p>Jack Lelanne was a popular name in American fitness throughout the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. He had a nationwide TV show for nearly 35 years in which he used calisthenics to help viewers get fitter from home.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3>\n<strong>2008 – YouTube calisthenics</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Hannibal Lanham – aka Hannibal for King – was partially responsible for beginning calisthenics into the new era of street workouts, with his hugely popular YouTube channel.</p>\n<h3><strong></strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>2011 – the first calisthenics federations</strong></h3>\n<p>In 2011, the World Street Workout and Calisthenics Federation and WSWCF (World Street Workout and Calisthenics Federation) were founded. These bodies organise events, champion new talent, and help standardise calisthenics into a sport.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The World Calisthenics Organization was founded in 2012 with the objective of promoting calisthenics and helping communities set up events, sites, and activities.</p>\n<p>If you’re a fan of calisthenics, or just getting into this incredible sport, check out the Gravity Fitness store for the best calisthenics and functional fitness kit around.

   "published": "September 14, 2022",
   "detail": " <p><strong>Hand care for calisthenics to prevent torn hands</strong></p>\n<p>Those callouses are there to protect you, here’s how to look after your hands for rig and ring work.</p>\n<p>Callouses are an inevitable part of your calisthenics journey (you could even say the two go hand in hand…) If you do any kind of rig or ring work, you can expect your hands to bear the brunt, especially in the early days as your skin gets used to gripping the bar.</p>\n<p>Hand care is an integral part of calisthenics, CrossFit, and gymnastics, and actually has a really interesting history. Let’s take a look back at it (gardening gloves and all) so you can create your own best-practice hand care routine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Callouses and calisthenics</strong></p>\n<p>Why do we get rough skin and callouses doing calisthenics and gymnastics work? It’s quite simple. All of a sudden, the skin on our hands is being compressed and curled around a bar, carrying our full body weight for dozens of reps. Mix in sweat and humidity and you can see why the skin on our hands might suffer.</p>\n<p>Callouses and rough skin aren’t a problem unless they rip, tear, or get infected. It’s worth understanding the various hand-care options out there so you can look after your hands and prevent tears.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The history of hand care in calisthenics</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Calisthenics and gymnastics are two of the oldest sports in physical culture. Modern methods of hand care like gymnastics grips, foot files and hand salve are relatively new inventions. So how did athletes back in the day look after their hands? Fun fact: before specific grips and tape were invented, many athletes favoured wearing rubber coated gardening gloves to protect their hands and add grip. But thick gloves will mess with your grip strength, so it’s best to care for your hands so you can use thin grips (or nothing at all).</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Why is hand care important for calisthenics</strong></p>\n<p>If rig or ring work is part of your training, you should make time for hand care. Just like brushing and flossing your teeth is a regular habit, make hand care a similar priority. Looking after your hands every few days will prevent callouses from building up too much, which in turn will stop them from ripping and causing big problems.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>5 tools and techniques for hand care and callouses</strong></p>\n<p>1 Smooth your skin. Keep rough areas of skin filed down with a pumice stone, foot file or similar. Do this 2-3 times a week to make sure there are no hard lumps of skin which can catch on the bar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 Shave your callouses. It’s a bit disgusting, but actually shaving individual callouses down will really help you maintain your hands and stop the callouses from getting to the point of no return.</p>\n<p>3 Use chalk. If you decide not to wear grips, use a bit of chalk to stop your hands from getting sweaty. Don’t use too much as this can actually create more friction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4 Use grips. You might decide that you want to wear something on your hands (it’s a personal preference). Aim for a thin layer rather than gloves – something like gymnastics grips or even tape.</p>\n<p>5 Adjust your grip. Look at how you grip the bar, rig or rings. The surface should be at the base of your fingers, not in the palm of your hands. Lots of people are simply gripping incorrectly and this leads to sore hands.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of no grips for bar work</strong></p>\n<p>There are pros and cons to wearing grips for bar work. Plenty of people prefer not to use anything. Ask a coach to take a look at your grip positioning and grip strength with and without. For some people, removing the grips or straps can transform their rig work and help you perform movements properly, which in turn will protect your shoulders.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What to do about torn hands and ripped callouses</strong></p>\n<p>So you’ve torn a callous – what next? Give it a good wash (yes, it will sting) because gyms aren’t always the most hygienic of places. Dry it well. Trim any excess skin carefully to prevent it from catching and tearing any further. If it’s small and more like a blister, leave it be.</p>\n<p>It’s important to keep the tear moist – dry skin will tear even more. Use hand cream, salve, or any similar product to stop the skin from drying out. Put gloves or long socks over your moisturised hands overnight to help the process.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you need to keep training, pop on a synthetic skin patch (like the “new skin” ones they make for bad blisters) and crack on. But if you can rest it for a few days, it will heal more quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The best way to look after your hands for calisthenics</strong></p>\n<p>Pumice or file rough skin regularly (at least once a week) to keep one step ahead of callouses. Shave down any big or persistent areas. Moisturise your hands with a thick cream or balm, ideally overnight so it can sink in. And then give your hands time to get use to the work – it won’t always be painful, we promise!</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Check out the Gravity Fitness store for functional fitness equipment and calisthenics kit including pull up bars, pull up racks, and wooden gymnastics rings.</p>"

   "detail": " <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><strong>Understanding your cycle and how it affects training</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have a menstrual cycle, you already know the different phases affect your appetite, energy levels, and mood. But how exactly does your cycle impact training – and what should you do to make the most of it?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What are the stages of the menstrual cycle?</strong></p>\n<p>Your cycle has two phases (punctuated by ovulation), and they can have a significant impact on your strength (real and perceived), mood, sleep, power, metabolic state, appetite and digestion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Day 0 - Day 14 (The Follicular Phase)</p>\n<p>From the day you start menstruating to 14 days later is the follicular phase, which is further broken down into the early and the late follicular phase. In the follicular phase, your body releases FSH (follicle stimulating hormone).</p>\n<p>Oestrogen levels start fairly low and rise during the late follicular phase, and progesterone stays low until it rises right at the end of this phase.</p>\n<p>Higher oestrogen levels can reduce appetite and dampen cravings for carby, fatty, sugary foods. It also improves insulin sensitivity and stabilises blood sugar levels.</p>\n<p>Oestrogen tends to have a positive effect on training, by boosting muscle growth, aiding recovery, and helping you feel less muscle soreness. Studies have shown that the more oestrogen you have in your blood, the harder you can contract your muscles. So if you feel strong and powerful in the first half of your cycle – you’re not imagining it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Day 14 (Ovulation)</p>\n<p>Around 14 days after your period starts, you’ll ovulate. This marks the start of the next phase which is called the luteal phase. You get a bump of testosterone at this point.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Day 15 - Day 28 (The Luteal Phase)</p>\n<p>The luteal phase is also divided into early and late phases. During this phase, oestrogen levels drop – and this can cause a drop in dopamine and serotonin, too. This can obviously impact mood, motivation, focus and drive for training.</p>\n<p>As that’s happening, progesterone levels are rising, and this is responsible for reduced insulin sensitivity, increased levels of ASP and LPL enzymes, reduced tendon strength, reduced recovery capabilities, and less ability to recruit muscle fibres. Great!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How does your cycle affect training?</strong></p>\n<p>You don’t need us to tell you how different the first half of your cycle can feel from the second. But reading the explanation of all the hormone changes puts it into context. Many women don’t feel much of a difference, but others will really notice feeling stronger, leaner, and more energised during the first half of their cycle…and hungrier, weaker, and less motivated in the second half.</p>\n<p>What does this mean for training? You can expect to feel stronger and more powerful in both body and mind during the follicular phase, so it makes sense to focus on big lifts and power moves in those weeks. You might feel slower and more tired in the luteal phase, and that’s a good time to programme a deload, work on weaknesses, or introduce more recovery sessions.</p>\n<p>Want one bit of good news about that luteal phase? All that extra progesterone can boost your BMR by up to 10%. This could mean your body burns 150+ more calories a day. (Good to know if you’re someone who finds themselves magnetically drawn to chocolate Hobnobs during that time…)</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What about PMS?</strong></p>\n<p>If you experience PMS symptoms at the end of the luteal phase, it might help to know it’s due to low oestrogen and low progesterone which are at their lowest levels for a few days at this point. This can lead to tiredness, muscle aches, digestive problems, poor co-ordination and more. The good news is this only lasts a few days.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What to expect during the phases of your cycle</strong></p>\n<p>Research into training during the menstrual cycle is inconclusive (probably because we’re all different!) but the general recommendations are to expect less hunger, more strength, more explosive power, and better recovery in the first two weeks of your cycle. Then in the final half of your cycle, you can reasonably expect diet to be more of a challenge, ad to feel weaker and less powerful in training.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How to eat and train during your cycle</strong></p>\n<p>One thing the research agrees on is that our strength levels actually don’t change much throughout our cycle. What can change is our energy levels, our motivation, and our perception of our strength.</p>\n<p>If you programme your own training or have a coach programming for you, it’s worth tracking your lifts, recovery, and energy levels. But note that your cycle doesn’t automatically mean your training will be impacted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nutrition is a different matter. Almost all women report significant changes in appetite, hunger, cravings and digestive health across their cycle. Capitalise on the lower hunger follicular phase (but don’t under-fuel your sessions). And make room for extra hunger in the luteal phase by increasing carbohydrates slightly, especially before training and maybe before bed.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follicular phase:</strong></p>\n<p>- cravings have decreased or vanished</p>\n<p>- reduce carbs and calories to normal levels</p>\n<p>- higher oestrogen levels mean better ability to use carbohydrates</p>\n<p>- best time for high intensity and low volume</p>\n<p>- low rep weight training, HIIT, sprinting</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Luteal phase:</strong></p>\n<p>- body is more likely to add body fat</p>\n<p>- you might experience more cravings</p>\n<p>- best time for lower intensity work or higher volume/</p>\n<p>- prioritise sleep and consider more rest days</p>\n<p>- a good time for a recovery or deload week</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Find the best functional training tools for every stage of training at the Gravity Fitness store.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gravityfitness.co.uk/collections/shop\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0276/0635/1961/files/shop_now_480x480.png?v=1650447069\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"202\" height=\"64\"></a></p>"

   "detail": " <p><strong>How to be fit over 40</strong></p>\n<p>Hit the 40 milestone? Forget calories and reps – here are the health factors that really matter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>40 might be the “new 30. But it’s still a big milestone. 40 these days looks a lot different to a generation ago. We’re more active, looking after ourselves better, and we have different expectations of what 40 feels like.</p>\n<p>How can we be fit after 40? The obvious answer might be “diet and exercise”. But we’d like to explore a different angle on 40+ health and fitness. Here are the health markers to keep in mind once you hit 40.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Waist measurement</strong></p>\n<p>Your waist measurement is one of the most reliable ways to track healthy body size and composition, and to catch increased visceral fat levels. Guidelines suggest men should aim for max 94cm (37in) waist circumference, and women max 80cm (31.5in).</p>\n<p><em>Goal: get the tape measure out and decide if you need to make lifestyle changes</em></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CV health</strong></p>\n<p>How fit are you really? We’re not talking about the fitness you’ve honed through years of gym workouts or sport. We mean true day-to-day fitness. Get out of your comfort zone and climb a big flight of stairs, heft some heavy stuff around, and spend half a day clearing the garden.</p>\n<p><em>Goal: be fit and strong enough to enjoy an active lifestyle</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Muscle mass</strong></p>\n<p>We all know BMI isn’t a great indicator of health, especially for people who train. But you do need to keep an eye on body composition. How much muscle mass do you have – and is it decreasing now you’ve hit 40? Take an honest look at your current muscle and body fat levels. It might be time to tinker with diet and training to avoid the dreaded slow slide.</p>\n<p><em>Goal: to maintain or even gain muscle mass throughout your 40s</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Eyes, ears and teeth</strong></p>\n<p>Sorry to say it, but things do start to fall apart a bit at this age. Do everything you can to maintain good general health, and catch things early. If you don’t go to the dentist regularly, now’s the time to start. If it’s been ages since you had a sight test, book one (and go for the OCT one where they test for glaucoma and macular degeneration). And it won’t hurt to get a hearing test, either.</p>\n<p><em>Goal: book all those health appointments you’ve been putting off</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Activity levels</strong></p>\n<p>How many hours per week do you spend being active? This doesn’t only mean workouts. Walking is just as relevant to health. Most of us find that figure declines from our 20s into our 30s and 40s. A sedentary lifestyle is a big risk factor in terms of heart health, stroke, type 2 diabetes, obesity and some cancers. Be intentional about stating active.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Goal: increase your weekly active hours by 10% (then add more if you can)</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Drinking habits</strong></p>\n<p>Changes to food and drink habits can sneak up on you. Is it time to do an audit of your snack choices, takeaway orders, and alcohol use? The goal isn’t a radical overhaul, or to return to the habits you had when you were a carefree 20-something. Just aim to reduce the least healthy aspects of your food and drink behaviours.</p>\n<p><em>Goal: less booze, more fruit and veg, see how you feel…</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Blood pressure</strong></p>\n<p>Blood pressure measures the force that’s pressed against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood. The top number (systolic) measures the pressure when your heart beats, and the bottom number (diastolic) measures the pressure between each beat. Average BP rises as we get older, but it’s still very important to keep an eye on yours. High blood pressure could indicate risk of heart disease, heart attack, or stroke. Take it seriously.</p>\n<p>Goal: aim for max 124/77 for men and 122/74 for women. Data shows that BP tends to average slightly higher for Black people (average 127/73). Hypertension is defined as systolic pressure of 130+ or diastolic of 80+ most of the time. If you have any concerns, see a doctor ASAP.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>4 risks factors for over 40s</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Heart – our risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke and aneurysm all increase at 40+ (sorry). It’s partly to do with physical changes, and partly to do with lifestyle factors. Prevention and vigilance are your best weapons.</p>\n<p>Obesity – obesity itself isn’t a risk factor, but obesity-related diseases are. These include heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers plus issue with mobility and loss of activity. Stay a healthy weight and keep an eye on that waist measurement.</p>\n<p>Stress – it’s unrealistic to tell people in their 40s to avoid stress. But it’s important that you manage it. Chronic stress can lead to overeating, poor sleep, depression, and a number of physical issues including heart attack. Reduce stress where you can.</p>\n<p>Activity – many people see activity levels drop off in their 40s. We know you don’t fall into this category, but keep an eye on it anyway. Carve out that time for training, make the effort to go on more walks, suggest social stuff that involves being active.</p>\n<p>The Gravity Fitness store has everything you need to stay active and enjoy training at every stage of life.

   "detail": " <p><u>How To Get In Shape As A Parent</u></p>\n<p>As a parent, it can be hard to find time to train. With family commitments, work and life’s other surprises training commitment can be a struggle. But how can you break the cycle as a parent? Set a more physical example for your children? Or do you just want to keep moving? I’m going to break down a few different strategies you can use as a parent to ensure you stay fit and healthy.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, you will need to frame your health and fitness as a priority and not something you just have to fit in. This means, when it comes to scheduling, you can take some time for yourself and have separate time, so that you can bring more positive energy back in afterwards. Adopting this mindset opens up the web to create good training habits and behaviours.</p>\n<p>Creating small and achievable goals from the outset will also help you to foster adherence to a programme as well as a sense of achievement. Break one big goal, like running 10km, down into smaller goals; start by running 2k, then 3, then 5, then 7 before reaching 10 for example. Think about what your goal will entail, and make that short structure work for you.</p>\n<p>Get your kids involved too! Go for a family bike ride, or trip to the pool. Throw them on your back when running, or doing press ups. Get them started with training too! This will make the time that you spend with your family fun and productive, whilst fostering good physical activity habits through the family. I have clients I train who have young children and they love to get&nbsp; involved with the sessions!</p>\n<p>You have to be prepared to mentally challenge yourself. This can be a tough one, especially if you have a stressful sedentary job. But willpower is incredibly important. Once you break through the barrier, you can start to create habitual behaviour, meaning you won’t have to think about your training, you can just pick it up and go, regardless of location too.</p>\n<p>Diet and nutrition will be one of, if not the most important thing you can make changes to. Making sure you have enough energy to manage the family life, work and train takes a lot of fine tuning but it’s definitely well worth it. Take up more fruit and veg, leafy greens and up your protein intake as a good baseline. Make sure you adequately hydrate, and you can always cut down on the odd glass of wine or two. But don’t stop living your life and not having food at a friends BBQ, just moderate things more of the course of the week to balance things out. This one will also be good for the family to follow. You can all set yourself challenges if you like that way of thinking, to make things more engaging.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can always journal and write down your progress, for nutrition and exercise, and make sure you beat your previous work next time. Have a little competition with yourself, to push yourself further and higher.</p>\n<p>Don’t try to do the typical parent thing and get it sorted straight away by blitzing it! That would do more harm than good. Tweak your routine and build up slowly and effectively. Make sure you schedule things to work for you, that will make everything easier to stick to.</p>\n<p>When you find a journey that works for you, you will be able to spend more time running around with the kids, supporting their hobbies and enjoying family time, as well as the bonus of being fitter, healthier and stronger for yourself. You’ll be lowering your risk of diseases and conditions that might crop up later on in life too.</p>\n<p>So what are you waiting for?

   "detail": " <p><u>The Effects Of Exercise On Dementia</u></p>\n<p>As we age, training and exercise tend to become less of a priority. We become less mobile, and after 60, our metabolism starts to slow down. The risks of illnesses and ailments become greater as our immune system changes. Dementia is one of the things that can be most concerning. Dementia is an umbrella of progressive changes in the brains chemistry, leading to neurons in the brain no longer working correctly effecting memory, cognitive function and spatial awareness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But what if we could slow down that process and have more energy? Preserve our mental acuity? Have more time with those we love? And a better standard of living? Well, regular training and exercise, have been scientifically proven to help. Regular training and exercise helps spatial memory and awareness, improves cognitive function and slows down the loss of grey matter through the brain as it ages. If we start exercising and training through our mid-life, we can also cut risk factors for any Dementia down considerably, as well as reducing risk factors for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Training is also a great way to bond with other people or family, which can greatly improve our emotional wellbeing, as well as fostering new relationships too.</p>\n<p>Physical exercise doesn’t have to be overly complicated for its benefits to become apparent. It could start with something as simple as going for a walk to the shops or run round the park, a light physical programme or resistance programme with a coach can also be an option. Exercise and physical training in general can also help with social skills and emotional wellbeing, meaning feeling psychologically and emotionally fitter and more healthy.</p>\n<p>Each generation is starting to live longer and longer, and to a healthier standard. This means training can be done long into our later years to keep us strong, active and mobile. Training this way doesn’t have to be started later on in life either. We can start from a young, or middle age. It’s never too late to start, or to keep being, physically active.</p>\n<p>Increasing our mobility and flexibility would be good places to start later in life. Using good form with bodyweight repetitions to make sure good form is present and injury risk lowered from the outset is extremely important.</p>\n<p>I have a few older clients I work with, and I always start right from the ground up, promoting proper form and engagement, especially if it has been a while since they have done any exercise! But the social interaction and seeing the result make the journey so worthwhile.</p>\n<p>We can set a great example for future generations by embracing exercise and resistance training throughout our lives, to help them push further work harder and foster a wonderful intergenerational bonding experience.</p>\n<p>I’ve listed an example workout you can use to get yourself started and see if training is for you, as you get older!</p>\n<p><em>BW Lunge L &gt; Squat &gt; Lunge R x 12</em><br><em> Shoulder Raise (Light Weight or Res.Band) x 12</em><br><em> Bicep Curl (Light Weight or Res.Band) x 12</em><br><em> Tricep Extension (Light Weight or Res.Band) x 12</em><br><em> Hip Hinge (Light Weight or Res.Band) x 12</em></p>\n<p>Repeat 2-4 times – plenty of rest and good form, and motor control are a must!</p>\n<p>We have plenty of products at all different weights on the Gravity Fitness store to help you make the most of your training and fitness.

   "detail": " <p><strong>How Chanting Can Boost Your Wellbeing And Recovery</strong></p>\n<p>Discover how chanting is making a comeback as we strive to stay rested in stressful times</p>\n<p>You’ve just about got your head around breathwork and meditation, what’s all this about chanting? We took a look at claims that chanting can boost wellbeing, support recovery, and even – maybe – help with long-term health.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What is chanting?</strong></p>\n<p>Think of chanting and you might have visions of yoga devotees on a mountain top retreat. Chanting has its roots in ancient Eastern practices, but it’s found its way into modern day wellness.</p>\n<p>Chanting simply means rhythmically saying a phrase over and over again – usually dozens of times. The practice combines meditation, breathwork, vibrations, and positive affirmations which is why many people believe it’s great for your physical and mental wellbeing.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What does science say about chanting?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There have been lots of legit studies about the effects of chanting on heart rate, HRV, central nervous system, depression, anxiety, sleep and recovery. One of the most recent – Ganagarajan et al., 2022 – concluded that brief chanting has a positive impact on “parasympathetic nervous system activity, promote relaxation, and provide calmness.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Is chanting a type of meditation?</strong></p>\n<p>Chanting can be used as a meditation, but we’re more interested in looking at its measurable effects on the body as part of our recovery strategy. In our research, we’ve found published papers and anecdotal stories that show a short amount of chanting lowers heart rate and blood pressure, improves sleep quality, promotes relaxation, helps digestion, and can help manage stress.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How chanting is linked to breathwork</strong></p>\n<p>We’ve written about breathwork techniques for lung capacity and rehab (check the blog <span><a href=\"https://www.gravityfitness.co.uk/blogs/training/rehab-your-lungs-after-illness-with-breathwork-exercises?_pos=1&amp;_sid=b4a14b2c7&amp;_ss=r\">here</a></span>.) Chanting can be considered a form of breathwork, and could be used as a way to tone the muscles of the diaphragm and lungs.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Chanting for training recovery</strong></p>\n<p>Does chanting really help recovery and adaptation from training? There haven’t been any specific studies into chanting in the athletic population, but there are plenty of papers linking chanting to respiratory vagal stimulation (Gerritsen, 2018), pulmonary function (Mooventhan, 2014) and autonomic cardiovascular rhythms (Bernardi, 2001). All of these things are important factors in recovering from intense training. So we say why not try chanting as part of your general wellness approach?</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>5 benefits of chanting</strong></p>\n<p>1 Chanting can quickly bring about a sense of calm and restfulness</p>\n<p>2 Chanting slows the heart rate and lowers blood pressure</p>\n<p>3 Chanting can focus the mind on positive outcomes and goals</p>\n<p>4 Chanting may help tackle symptoms of depression and anxiety</p>\n<p>5 Chanting can support the flow of oxygenated blood to the brain</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Your 3-step guide to start chanting</strong></p>\n<p>Have we got you interested in chanting? If you’d like to get started but don’t want to alarm the neighbours, here are some modern-day ways to practice chanting (no yoga mat required).</p>\n<p>1 Find a quiet spot where you can sit (ideally on the floor).</p>\n<p>2 Close your eyes and place one or both hands lightly over your chest</p>\n<p>3 Inhale deeply then chant on the exhale (not sure what to chant? Start with the classic “ommm”</p>\n<p>4 Try chanting with your mouth shut (to feel the vibrations) or with your mouth wide open – both have different effects on the mind and body</p>\n<p>5 Keep practicing – even 5 minutes a few times a week will make a difference to your wellbeing</p>\n<p>Design your own perfect functional fitness and wellbeing lifestyle – check out our full range of functional training equipment in the Gravity Fitness online store.</p>"

   "detail": " <p><strong>7 Health Hacks For Your Home That Really Work</strong></p>\n<p>How healthy is your home environment? Here’s how to optimise your space to support your mind and body.</p>\n<p>We’ve never spent as much time at home as we do now. Many of us live, work, sleep and socialise in our homes. If home is where you spend the majority of your time, it makes sense to think about how the space is affecting your health and habits. Here are 7 proven ways to make your home environment healthier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Give your kitchen a makeover</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The state of your kitchen can make or break healthy eating habits. The consumer behaviourist and author of “Mindless Eating” Brian Wansink suggests we all organise our kitchens to make healthy eating easier.</p>\n<p>Clear counter tops and work surfaces so “quick grab” foods are out of sight. Put any trigger foods (like crisps or biscuits) away, ideally on a high shelf or in an opaque container. Have healthy food readily available so you are less likely to snack.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Air-purifying plants</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Spending a lot of time in the same indoor environment can have detrimental effects on your breathing, especially if your home is made of synthetic building materials or has lots of modern furnishings.</p>\n<p>Air purifying plants are an easy and attractive way to offset all that time indoors. Not only do they literally clear the air, but they look great and help bring a touch of nature indoors to boost your mental wellbeing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Good options for pet-friendly air purifying houseplants include calathea, pothos, sansevieria (snake plant), spider plants, rubber plants, and most palms and ferns.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Install a water filter</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Tap water is fine to drink, but can contain impurities and trace heavy metals which may build up over time. You probably drink more water than most, so why not install a water filter?</p>\n<p>Depending on your budget, choose between a water jug filter that you have to refill, or a faucet or under-sink filter that will filter the water as it comes out of the tap.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Declutter and delineate your space</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It’s true that a tidy space helps a tidy mind. Clutter can be stressful and annoying – a reminder of yet another job you don’t have time to do. Try to keep key areas of your home clutter free. Your entrance hall, dining table, living room and desk are good places to start.</p>\n<p>If you work from home, it’s really important to keep work and relaxation areas separate. If you have an office, great. But if you need to work from the dining room table, make sure you can pack your work stuff away so it doesn’t loom over your evenings and weekends.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Create space to relax</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It’s really important to have a calm and relaxing space to call your own, even if you live in the smallest of flats. Figure out what works for you – do you need a blanket and candles, a cosy corner, or a bright spot? Make sure everyone else in the home knows that’s your little sanctuary for unwinding, reading, journaling or whatever you need to do.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Use blackout blinds</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Light and noise can make the home environment downright stressful. If you suffer with noisy neighbours, outside lights from streetlamps or flood lights, or any other disturbance then install barriers to protect your peace.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Blackout blinds are a brilliant way to block out unwanted light – crucial if your bedroom is subject to light from the outside.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Optimise your bedroom</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Quality sleep is crucial to physical recovery and mental wellbeing. Do everything you can to make your bedroom a space where good sleep happens. Keep it clear from clutter (dedicate 5 minutes a day to clearing away any mess that’s built up). Make sure it’s as dark as possible, eliminating light from outside but also lights from electronics and switches in the room. Add soft furnishings and plats to absorb noise. And keep your phone out of the bedroom – it’s a tough habit to start, but one of the healthiest things you can do.</p>\n<p>Check out our range of functional fitness and recovery equipment to support your healthy lifestyle habits.</p>"

   "detail": " <p><strong>How to use cold water therapy as biohacking</strong></p>\n<p>Can cold water therapy do more than boost recovery? Tap into the physical and mental benefits of extreme cold.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What is cold water therapy?</strong></p>\n<p>Cold water therapy – from cold showers to cryo chambers – has been used for decades by athletes seeking faster recovery from training. But cold water and ice therapy has reached new heights of popularity, with some experts saying it’s the ultimate biohack.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some people now believe cold water therapy can stimulate virus-killing cells, induce cold thermogenesis, and even prolong your lifespan. And since cold water is pretty widely available (especially in the UK!), maybe it’s the best new addition to your healthy lifestyle…</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Why do cold water therapy?</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;For most people, using cold water to boost recovery or bring down inflammation makes sense on a logical level. Cold is the opposite of the heat of damaged, inflamed tissue. But maybe there’s more to cold water therapy than just feeling good after a tough training session.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>6 benefits of cold water therapy</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s assume you’re on board with the idea of using cold water immersion as part of your training recovery. Here are seven more anecdotal reasons to try it (there’s not much by way of scientific research yet).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>1 Boost metabolic output</strong></p>\n<p>Some research has shown that cold water leads to cold thermogenesis, which activates brown fat cells. These cells create heat in cold conditions, and therefore increase your overall metabolic rate. There have been some interesting studies into long-distance cold water swimmers and brown fat cells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2 Support immune system function</strong></p>\n<p>It’s thought that cold water immersion stimulates leukocytes, the white blood cells that help fight off infection and viruses. Cold also makes the lymphatic system contract, which sends fluid through the lymph nodes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>3 Improve circulation</strong></p>\n<p>Cold water or cryotherapy causes blood vessels to constrict which temporarily reduces blood flow to muscles. This activity can improve circulation in the long term.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>4 An opportunity for mindfulness</strong></p>\n<p>It might sound bizarre, but submitting to cold water (especially in a beautiful natural setting) gives you the chance to switch off and get mindful. In a busy, noisy world this can be a golden opportunity to connect with yourself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>5 Increased mental strength</strong></p>\n<p>Once you’ve successfully got into cold water and stayed there, you’ll know what you’re capable of. All of a sudden that 1RM attempt or final sprint rep won’t seem so daunting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>6 Boost physical and mental energy</strong></p>\n<p>Cold water doesn’t give you extra energy, but it definitely energises you. A morning dip can wake you up for the day, boost your mood, and give you mental clarity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Leading practitioners of cold water therapy</strong></p>\n<p>We probably don’t have to tell you about Wim Hof – “The Iceman” – who has become the poster boy for extreme cold water and ice therapy. His studies, adventures, and writings are dedicated to promoting the physical and mental benefits of cold water (and cold conditions in general).</p>\n<p>If you want to read up on other fascinating characters who have found a second home in cold water, check out endurance swimmer and ocean advocate Lewis Pugh, legendary open water swimmer Lynne Cox (who swam the Bering Strait during the Cold War), and ice swimmer Josef Koeberl.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How to use cold water therapy in your own lifestyle&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>You might not fancy swimming across the North Pole, but maybe you want to have a bit of cold water therapy in your life. If you live by the coast (or a lake), it’s pretty easy. But do be careful. Build up your tolerance slowly, never swim or dip in bad weather, and always have someone with you. Never underestimate the power of the sea.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Best low-cost cold water therapy ideas&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Cold showers – simply take a short cold shower, or turn your shower to its coldest setting at the end of your normal shower. Build up to 3-5 minutes.</p>\n<p>Ice baths – fill a bath with ice and cold water, or invest in a purpose-built ice bath or plunge tub if you really think you’ll use it enough.</p>\n<p>Open water dips – enjoy a dip in the sea, lake, or river but please be careful. Get to know local tides and currents, always let someone know where you’re going (or have someone with you) and if there are lifeguards present, heed their advice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cryotherapy – certainly not cheap, but a fast and done-for-you way to access the benefits of this most extreme form of cold therapy.</p>\n<p>Check out our full functional fitness range at the Gravity store <span><a href=\"https://www.gravityfitness.co.uk/collections/shop\">here</a></span> and start building your own fitness lifestyle collection.</p>"

   "detail": " <p><strong>How to live a Stoic fitness lifestyle</strong></p>\n<p>The Stoic philosophers might have lived 2000 years ago, but their principles of balance and optimism are more relevant than ever. Here’s what the Stoics had to say about food, fitness, and wellbeing – and how you can apply it to your own healthy lifestyle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What is Stoicism?</strong></p>\n<p>You might know “stoic” as a way to describe a person who is calm, pragmatic, and kind of unflappable. But the word comes from the ancient Greek school of philosophy which began around 300 BC.</p>\n<p>The best-known Stoic thinkers include Seneca, Epictetus, and emperor Marcus Aurelius (their letters and written philosophies have been published) but the first named Stoic is Zeno of Citium 300 years before Seneca.</p>\n<p>Stoicism spread far and wide and was practiced for hundreds of years, by leaders, politicians, writers, and everyday people. In recent years, it’s re-entered public consciousness and is used by many as a set of guiding principles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What were the Stoic principles?</strong></p>\n<p>It would take more than one blog post to outline Stoic philosophy, so here’s our take on the key Stoic principles of virtue, responsibility, courage, and justice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Live according to nature, we are all part of it</li>\n<li>Happiness comes from our values and choices</li>\n<li>We can’t control what happens, we can only control our reactions</li>\n<li>We have everything we need to live well within us already</li>\n<li>Living well means eliminating negative emotions</li>\n<li>Take responsibility, don’t complain or blame others</li>\n<li>Don’t be selfish; we live in a connected society</li>\n<li>Progress over perfection: the work is what matters most</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What did the Stoics say about health and fitness?</strong></p>\n<p>The ancient Stoics valued physical exercise and healthy eating, but they warned against doing either thing to excess or with pride. Stoicism is pragmatic and views ageing as an inevitability. That’s not to say that the Stoics didn’t care about improving their health and wellbeing. They maintained simple, no-fuss routines that kept the mind and body in balance through walking, simple food, and sport as a way to connect with fellow man.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How to live like a modern-day Stoic</strong></p>\n<p>Stoics are famous for taking action rather than just talking about things. They are philosophers who demonstrate by doing. Lots of the famous Stoics were athletes: Chrysippus was a long-distance runner, Cleanthes was a boxer, and Plato (admired by the Stoics) was a wrestler.</p>\n<p>When you’re a Stoic, you live your principles. So if health and fitness are core values, you need to walk the talk.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How physical fitness fits with Stoicism</strong></p>\n<p>For the Stoics, physical training wasn’t a way to show off strength or develop a great physique. Sport and fitness were active ways to demonstrate core Stoic principles: hard work, progress, resilience, effort, and taking responsibility for your own life rather than blaming external factors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Create your own Stoic lifestyle</strong></p>\n<p>Take responsibility for your health. Yes, external factors will impact your mind and body, but that’s life. There’s plenty you can do to optimise the good and minimise the bad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Take the lessons that training gives you. Sport and fitness will present plenty of opportunity for hard work, progress, courage, judgement, team work, and humility. Accept the lessons with grace.</p>\n<p>Take the ego out of training. See sport and fitness as a way to honour your core values of health and longevity, not a way to be better than anyone else.</p>\n<p>Spend time in nature. Stoics don’t get caught up in fads and hype, they stick to tried-and-tested methods using the body and natural environment.</p>\n<p>Remember your body is organic matter. It will break down eventually, but in the meantime it’s your duty to look after it. Move it, rest it, feed it natural healthy food, and give it plenty of water.</p>\n<p>Ditch the “lone wolf” attitude. It’s important to acknowledge other people’s role in your training journey, whether that’s coaches, team mates, supporters, or people who inspire you.</p>\n<p>Push your body and mind. Growth comes when you place yourself in a state of discomfort, so use intense exercise, skills-learning, and self-control to bring about a Stoic style of growth.</p>\n<p>Deal with setbacks. Injuries, illness, not making the team… fitness involves knock backs. You can’t control what happens, but you can always control how you think, react, and move forward.</p>\n<p>Are you a fan of Stoic thinking? Us too.

   "detail": " <p><strong>How To Live Healthy The Other 23 Hours Of The Day</strong></p>\n<p>Training is a tiny fraction of our daily routine – are you optimising the other 23 hours?</p>\n<p>Even the smartest and most logical amongst us will place more importance on training than on – say – the hour between finish work and eating dinner. It’s understandable. After all, training is energetic and results-driven.</p>\n<p>But the fact remains that training only takes up a very small percentage of our 24-hour cycle. The rest of it is wide open, and the decisions we make will affect how healthy it is.</p>\n<p>Here’s how to live the other 23 hours of your day in the healthiest way possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Wake up at the same time every day</strong></p>\n<p>Research shows that keeping a regular sleep/wake pattern helps get the most from your circadian rhythm. Try to wake up at roughly the same time (within 30 minutes) even on your days off. Doing this can improve your mood, focus and alertness and even reduce insomnia symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Don’t hit the snooze button</strong></p>\n<p>Become the kind of person who gets up at the first alarm (and ideally make it a sunrise alarm that mimics natural light). Avoiding the snooze button won’t just make you more productive and less stressed, it will actually lead to a better sense of self-esteem.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Drink a glass of water</strong></p>\n<p>We all love coffee, but what your body really wants after 7-9 hours in bed is some water. Drink at least one glass of water (whilst your coffee is brewing if necessary).</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Take 10 minutes for yourself</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t let the day rush in and take over straight away. Set aside 10 minutes for yourself every morning, regardless of how busy you are. It doesn’t matter what you use it for. You could journal, read, sit in the garden with a coffee, pet the dog, or do some stretches. Stay away from your phone, email and the news.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Get outside in the sunlight</strong></p>\n<p>Your body’s circadian clock is most sensitive to light just before bedtime and for an hour after you wake up. Get outside in the sunlight within 1 hour of waking. It will help your body regulate its sleep and wake cycle and help you avoid sleep issues.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Move your body before work</strong></p>\n<p>Training is all well and good, but you need to stay active throughout the day. Don’t be one of those people who sits around all day “because you trained”. Start as you mean to go on by getting some movement in before work. This could be a walk or a bit of stretching – whatever you need.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Take your supplements</strong></p>\n<p>If you take vitamin supplements, creatine mono, or any other daily supplement then build it into your morning routine so you don’t forget. It’s all part of creating a healthy lifestyle that ticks over on a 24/7 basis.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Present yourself well</strong></p>\n<p>We’re not telling you what you should look like, but taking care of your appearance is an important part of living a healthy lifestyle. Looking after the basics of personal hygiene and grooming will bolster your self-esteem and confidence, and that leads to a positive outlook.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Eat protein in every meal (including breakfast)</strong></p>\n<p>Protein isn’t just for pre- and post-training meals. Make sure every meal, snack, or mini meal throughout your day includes a bit of protein. And keep it varied, especially if you favour a plant-based eating style.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Make meals from scratch</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nobody has time to cook every meal from scratch, but it’s a good habit to chase. If in doubt, make a meal rather than reaching for the delivery menu.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Connect with friends or family</strong></p>\n<p>Emotional wellbeing is just as important as physical health, so make sure you stay connected with people who make you feel good about life. This might mean a quick phone call, a voice note, or a flurry of memes to a mate. Don’t let yourself get isolated.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do something towards your goals</strong></p>\n<p>As fitness folk, we’re familiar with the concept of pushing towards a goal. But do you have non-fitness goals for your life? They don’t have to be big or impressive. But having ambitions will give your life direction. Be sure to do something that moves the needle towards your goal.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do something that makes you laugh</strong></p>\n<p>Laughter and silliness are linked with better physical and mental health. As adults, we often lose touch with playfulness. Do something every day that makes you smile, laugh, or full-on lose it. If in doubt, watch some comedy on TV.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Spend time in nature</strong></p>\n<p>Being in nature is linked with loads of health benefits, including lower blood pressure, reduced risk of heart disease, and less chance of depression. Try to get outside in your nearest patch of nature, even if it’s just pulling a few weeds in the garden.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Care for your body</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t let 24 hours whiz by without looking after yourself. Life isn’t all about training and work. Take 10 minutes to stretch, do mobility work, or ease out that niggle in your neck.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Relax… really relax</strong></p>\n<p>Most people go entire days without truly feeling relaxed. Take time before bed to really unwind, even if this means lying flat on your back and doing absolutely nothing. Our central nervous system takes a battering from noise, technology, and external stress. Give it a chance to regroup.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>No phones in the bedroom</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, the tough one. Get into the habit of leaving your phone in another room (perhaps downstairs charging) overnight. Having your phone in the bedroom is terrible for your sleep patterns and sleep quality. The blue light plays havoc with your brain’s ability to rest, and the temptation to scroll is there if you wake up.</p>\n<p>Create your own at-home active lifestyle collection.

   "detail": " <p><strong><u>Healthy Alternative Methods For Longevity</u></strong></p>\n<p>We, as human beings, are always looking for ways to make our lifestyles more productive, and to be more healthy (physically, mentally and emotionally). And, with more access to science (which has improved our understanding of our bodies), more alternative treatments and more data to access, the human body has never been so understood. But are there some simple alternative methods we can use to enrich our daily lives and keep us functioning in the best possible way? And the answer is yes, there are some tips and tricks we can use that don’t involve crazy hyperbaric chambers!</p>\n<p><em>Cold Water Immersion + temperature changes</em></p>\n<p>Cold water immersion is a fantastic way to keep us healthy. It helps our muscles recover, reducing DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) after exercise. It helps circulation, flush waste products from the body and can help to increase metabolic rate. Putting our bodies through more temperature extremes helps keeps our system functioning optimally, whether cold water immersion, or a sauna, for example. Both effectively fire up the bodies’ systems to help us regulate ourselves and ‘shock the system’.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Fasting</em></p>\n<p>Fasting can be a great way to manage our food intake, particularly if you have an odd routine. The principal of fasting basically means you only take in calories in a certain timeframe during the day. Normally this means you take on less calories, making it easier to lose weight, but it’s not some kind of miracle, despite what some may tell you. To lose weight you HAVE to be in a caloric deficit, and that’s it. Sometimes, depending on context, fasting helps with that. There are now apps out there so you can track your circadian rhythms and fast appropriately, but again, always listen to your body. And don’t attempt anything too drastic too quickly. I, for example, prefer to have my first meal later in the day, and my last meal fairly early because I don’t like training in the mornings with a full stomach. And it suits my routine of keeping my energy up at times when I have the most work or more clients. So be careful, don’t listen to any crazy zealots out there, but just do what works for you and your body.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Taking care of our gut</em></p>\n<p>Keeping your gut healthy is often overlooked as a standard, but it helps regulate so much of the body, including hormone production, organ regulation and brain function. The guut is often referred to as ‘the second brain’, so we should be doing all we can to keep it healthy. Anything that can reduce inflammation provides a happy healthy gut. I enjoy a Tumeric Latte on occasion, and Turmeric is a great anti-inflammatory. Probiotics keep the gut bacteria nice and healthy, and with a healthier gut comes healthier skin too.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Being sociable and enjoying our hobbies</em></p>\n<p>Being sociable and active helps our mental and physical health. And this is also emotionally enriching. This may seem like a straightforward and obvious one, but with increased positivity and emotional health we can potentially live longer. This in turn will alleviate stress and help us find new purpose, hobbies and meet new people.</p>\n<p><em>Getting a good nights sleep</em></p>\n<p>Sleep is key to recovery and bodily function. A good nights sleep can work wonders for any physical, emotional or mental blocks. People cannot change whether they are early risers or night owls, but getting a good 7-9 hours should work wonders. Poor sleep can lead to health complications in the long run, so make sure you get plenty of rest to keep your longevity.</p>\n<p><em>Analysing your DNA</em></p>\n<p>For those with a scientific disposition, you can have your DNA mapped to show you common traits, to really analyse how your body is made up, what your genetic markers may point towards in later life and appropriate micronutrient supplementation. This is definitely a more expensive option, and again, make sure you do your research on companies that are offering this service. But this really could be the future of personalised medicine in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Boosting Your Mitochondria</em></p>\n<p>Simply put, Mitochondria are key to the make up of your cells and producing ATP (energy). If you keep your Mitochondria happy, you’ll have more energy. Appropriate supplementation, a good diet and exercise will go a long way to keep your Mitochondria happier and healthier, for longer. A good supply of Zinc, Omega-3’s and Magnesium can help here, as well as more intensive training methods, such as HIIT, keeping you firing on all cylinders.</p>\n<p><em>FYI: Urban Myth: Blue Light</em></p>\n<p>The urban myth of blue light being significantly damaging to health has been around for a long time now. There has not been any proven research or science behind it. More blue light is emitted from the sun, than from any electronic devices. Is using less electronic devices, especially before bedtime, a good thing? Absolutely. Because it gets us out and about and taking in some fresh air, and can help us not overstimulate our brains before sleeping. But that has nothing to do with any blue light transmission. Blue light is a part of the UV spectrum, which is consistently all around us as a part of the visible light spectrum. The UK chemist Boots was sued because they were claiming that blue light can damage retinal cells, and there wasn’t and still is not, any evidence to prove that. Just a little fun fact for you!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

And increasing numbers of people are exploring how some of these rituals and experiences can enhance their health and wellness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We’re not here to comment on the safety of these practices, nor are we going to tell you if you should or shouldn’t do them. Let’s explore what science says about ayahuasca and kambo.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the origin of rituals like Ayahuasca?</strong></p>\n<p>Ayahuasca (a tea-like brew), kambo (the poisonous secretions of the kambo frog) and San Pedro (a South American cactus) are used in the context of rituals or ceremonies. They have ancient cultural roots, often associated with shamanism, and are said to help bring clarity and cleansing.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What is Ayahuasca?</strong></p>\n<p>Ayahuasca is a tea-like brew made from the leaves of the Psychotria viridis shrub and stalks of the Banisteriopsis caapi vine. It was traditionally taken by Amazonian tribes, and is still used as a sacred ritual by some communities in Brazil. Modern Ayahuasca ceremonies are led by a shaman or another experienced healer.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What does Ayahuasca do?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The two plants used in Ayahuasca contain psychedelic substances and MAO-inhibitors which combine to bring about a hallucinogenic experience. Ayahuasca affects the central nervous system and can lead to a state of euphoria or an out of body experience. An Ayahuasca experience can last 2-6 hours and may include adverse side-effects like vomiting or diarrhoea.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Why do people do Ayahuasca?</strong></p>\n<p>Supervised Ayahuasca rituals are offered at retreats in South America. People who go to these retreats seek mental and physical cleaning or a breakthrough.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>People are advised to abstain from tobacco and alcohol before the ceremony, and often eat a super-clean or even a vegan diet beforehand. Anecdotal claims state this rids the body of toxins so the ayahuasca can be more beneficial.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6007657/\">Scientific studies</a></span> suggest that Ayahuasca could be useful for treating addiction, anxiety, depression and PTSD. <span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4910400/\">This systematic review</a></span> of 25-years’ worth of clinical trials concludes that “several basic, experimental, and clinical studies suggest that these drugs have anxiolytic, anti-depressive, and antiaddictive effects…. the reviewed studies suggest that the therapeutic use of classic hallucinogens may offer to some patients fast-acting and prolonged beneficial effects after a single dose, producing few adverse effects. Indeed, interest in the medicinal uses of this class of drugs is increasing.”</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Is Ayahuasca safe?</strong></p>\n<p>Ayahuasca is unregulated, and people take part in ceremonies knowing the risks and potential adverse effects. Like any drug, Ayahuasca can bring about a positive or a negative experience. Some people report euphoria, clarity, and an extreme feeling of enlightenment. Others experience panic, anxiety, and trauma of the nervous system.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What is kambo?</strong></p>\n<p>Like ayahuasca, kambo originates from South America and can still be accessed there as guided experiences. Kambo is named after the poisonous secretions used in the ritual, which come from the Phyllomedusa bicolor giant monkey frog.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Is kambo safe?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is very little scientific research into kambo, and you have to remember that the frog secretions used in the ritual are actually poisonous. The way it’s administered carries health risks, too, with small burns made with a burning stick and the blistered skin peeled off before the poison is applied to the flesh. Side effects of kambo include vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach cramps, dizziness, heart palpitations and sweeling of the face.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Why do people do kambo?</strong></p>\n<p>People seek out kambo ceremonies for help with addition, anxiety, depression, chronic pain and other health issues. Unfortunately there isn’t much scientific research to prove or disprove use of kambo. The best paper we could find is <span><a href=\"https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/iacp/international-archives-of-clinical-pharmacology-iacp-4-017.pdf\">this 2018 paper</a></span> published in the International Archies of Clinical Pharmacology, which outlined the risks, grey areas, and misconceptions about kambo.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A healthy lifestyle starts with the positive habits you make in your daily life.

   "detail": " <p><strong><u>Strip Back Your Fitness Lifestyle And Live Your Best Life</u></strong></p>\n<p>The fitness industry is going through a huge boom at the moment, especially through social media platforms. This means there’s a lot of misinformation, fad diets and complication out there. This onslaught can make things seem hugely overwhelming, but just think for a minute about where our ancestors came from, how they survived being within the food chain and how they shaped the world for us today.</p>\n<p>Our ancestors were, at times, prey but they were also hunters. Being lean, fast, strong and agile were essential qualities to have to endure and survive. The modern world has it’s own parallel challenges, but those simple instincts have been lost somewhat. But keeping healthy, fit and well runs alongside how our ancestors lived (excuse the pun).</p>\n<p>Through our own training we can strip things back, make things simpler and create a more positive mental and emotional attitude, leading to greater happiness fulfilment and ultimately better training. But how can we go about making sure we are getting back to our ancestral lifestyle in the best way?</p>\n<p>Well removing complication is a great start. In terms of training, if you’re struggling through complicated movements or skills, strip back those exercises, focus on their component parts and regress movements back to their original forms, but add weight to compensate. This way you can always work, on the fundamentals and keep your form on point, whilst also moving through all the planes of motion with full range.</p>\n<p>Diet is another area that can be overcomplicated, especially with so much misinformation on weight loss out there. Simply creating a caloric deficit and eating less calories than you’re burning is the way to start, but making sure you’re being consistent and not overly restrictive is also very important. Food is delicious, so make sure any treats you’re having, you’re enjoying in moderation – and also make sure you’re consuming as much as possible from whole food sources, with enough protein. Nothing else needed here really – just the simple stuff.</p>\n<p>Even just increasing your time outside, whether walking, running or enjoying your hobbies can help us regain a sense of oneness with the world and nature. This is easier in the warmer weather of course, but just starting to breathe in that fresh air and sunlight helps us to become recentred. Spending less time at a desk helps too, even if it’s only for shorter periods during the day. Every hour or so take a break and go outside briefly if you can, or just do some stretches at your desk, just to keep mobile. Our ancestors were constantly on the move, so any movement is definitely going to get you back into your ancestral mindset.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For some it could be spending less time with technology or on social media. Try not to use technology too close to bed time, just to give yourself a break. Maybe deleting social media apps in short bursts, or cutting down on their usage, will help you recentre. Just make sure this is done gradually. Going cold turkey with anything can be overly restrictive, so just do it with mini steps and you’ll get back to basics.</p>\n<p>For some this might not be as simple and free form as just following these steps, you may need to make a routine and plan for these types of events and circumstances. I know I do!</p>\n<p>Creating a plan for how you want to train going forward, and having a structure, is essential. Even if you find it ends up being less effective for you down the line. We only learn by making mistakes and this helps us to find and hone our weaknesses, and correct them, to live our strongest lives possible.</p>\n<p>Emotionally some people like to journal to put thoughts and emotions down on a page, this can help cast negativity away from you so you can focus on your achievements and the positive steps you’ve made to live a simpler and better life.</p>\n<p>Recalibrating and simplifying ones life is so important, so make sure to take stock every few months or so, like you would as a business owner, to make sure you’re on the right track for you. This way you won’t get stuck into the overly complicated small things. Keep yourself accountable and in check and you should manage just fine, and you’ll be able to go back to living a simpler, better life. Ask for help when you need it, get to know new people and explore new communities and you never know where your new ancestral life might take you!</p>"
