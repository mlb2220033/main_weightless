It also helps with learning calisthenic elements. You still don’t have the strength to do your first pull-up or your first Muscle up? The resistance band will help you achieve this!\nIn our offer you will also find a set of 4 resistance rubbers.\n-Made of 100% latex\n-Easy to clean (just clean with a damp sponge)\n-Thickness 4.5 mm, width 50 mm.\nTraining bands come in different colors and thicknesses, not by chance. The thinner the gum, the less it will help you. So how do you choose the color of the exercise band? In fact, all colors of rubber will be useful in training. Training bands can be used for many different exercises and levels of advancement. How does it look in practice? Let’s assume that your goal is 5 pull-ups and you start with 1. You can use green rubber to develop the correct technique, get your body used to working in full range of motion, and slowly strengthen your muscles. After a few workouts, you will change the color of the rubber to purple (which makes it more difficult for you). And so on However, if you are wondering how rubbers can make exercise difficult for you, we recommend trying to do a series of push-ups with rubbers."

Training bands can be used for many different exercises and levels of advancement. How does it look in practice? Let’s assume that your goal is 5 pull-ups and you start with 1. You can use green rubber to develop the correct technique, get your body used to working in full range of motion, and slowly strengthen your muscles. After a few trainings, you will change the color of the rubber to purple (making your task more difficult).

You still don’t have the strength to do your first pull-up or your first Muscle up? The power bands will help you achieve this!\nIn our offer, you can also find a set of resistance bands!\n-Made of 100% latex\n-Easy to clean (just clean with a damp sponge)\n-Thickness 4.5 mm, width 13 mm.\nTraining bands come in different colors and thicknesses, not by chance. The thinner the band, the less it will help you. So how do you choose the color of the workout band? In fact, all colors will be useful in your workouts. Training bands can be used for many different exercises and levels of advancement. How does it look in practice? Let’s assume that your goal is 5 pull-ups and you start with 1. You can use green rubber to develop the correct technique, get your body used to working in full range of motion, and slowly strengthen your muscles. After a few trainings, you will change the color of the rubber to purple (making your task more difficult). And so on over and over again However, if you are wondering how rubbers can make the exercise more difficult, we recommend trying out a set of push-ups with rubbers."
